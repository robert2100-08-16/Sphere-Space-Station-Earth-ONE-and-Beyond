### 8.4.6 Wow Factors

#### 8.4.6.1 Highlights

* **Orbital City Scale** – The station's 127 m diameter habitat supports roughly 700 residents, evoking the image of a small city in orbit.
* **Multi-Deck Gravity** – Sixteen coaxial decks transition from microgravity at the axis to near‑1 g at the outer hull, blending research flexibility with human comfort.
* **Robust Power Systems** – Two 60 MW nuclear reactors, backed by solar arrays and thermal storage, deliver a combined 120 MW in space—unprecedented for a single platform.
* **Integrated Safety Concept** – Distributed evacuation pods, radiation‑shielded zones, and layered redundancy ensure preparedness for severe contingencies.
* **Solar-System Network Vision** – Earth ONE serves as the first node in an envisioned chain of habitats and transport links extending from Venus orbit to the Kuiper Belt.
* **Professional Documentation** – A ten‑document baseline, complete with tables, diagrams, and an AI‑supported QA pipeline, underscores the project's industrial‑grade planning.
