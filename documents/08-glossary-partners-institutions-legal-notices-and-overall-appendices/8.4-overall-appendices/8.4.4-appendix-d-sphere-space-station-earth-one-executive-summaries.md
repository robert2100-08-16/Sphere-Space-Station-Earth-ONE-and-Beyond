# 1 . Executive Summary – Technical, Science & Research Decision-Makers (e.g., ESA Director)

The **Sphere Space Station Earth ONE** is a modular, rotating spherical habitat with a diameter of ~127 meters, designed primarily for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations and scalable to Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Lagrange points, and deep-space locations such as the Asteroid Belt.  

Its engineering integrates:  
- **Artificial gravity** via 4–5 rpm spin rate, delivering ~1g on outer decks.  
- **Polar “bus terminal” docking** for efficient, safe, and separated inbound/outbound traffic.  
- **SiC composite structures** for superior thermal, mechanical, and radiation resilience.  
- **Closed-loop life support systems**, advanced radiation shielding, and dynamic attitude control.  

The station is conceived as both a **standalone operational hub** and a **node in a larger interplanetary infrastructure**, supporting scientific research, industrial production, crew training, and long-term habitation. Its design draws on validated spaceflight data, terrestrial analogs, and advanced simulation models, making it ready for phased deployment with minimal technological gaps.
