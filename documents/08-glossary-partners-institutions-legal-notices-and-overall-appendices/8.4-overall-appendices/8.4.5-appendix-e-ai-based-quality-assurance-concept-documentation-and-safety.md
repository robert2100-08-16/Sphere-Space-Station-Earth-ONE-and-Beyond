### 8.4.5 AI-Based Quality Assurance Concept – Documentation & Safety

#### 8.4.5.1 Objective

Ensure that all technical, organizational, and safety-relevant content of the *Sphere Space Station Earth ONE & Beyond* project is factually correct, consistent, and complete — and that life safety aspects (Safety) are verifiably met at all times.

#### 8.4.5.2 QA Structure

| QA Level                       | Focus                                                      | AI Function                                  | Methods                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QA-1: Factual Accuracy**     | Fact-checking (technology, figures, dimensions, processes) | LLM with technical fact and standards check  | - Cross-check against internal “Single Source of Truth” (Sec. 8.4.2) <br> - Check against external standards (ISO, NASA, ESA) |
| **QA-2: Consistency**          | Uniformity between chapters and documents                  | Semantic comparison by AI                    | - Detection of contradictions (e.g., material density, break-even timelines) <br> - Version comparison                        |
| **QA-3: Completeness**         | Check that all mandatory content is included               | AI-assisted checklist review                 | - Compare with master template for each document type <br> - Flagging of MISSING items                                        |
| **QA-4: Safety Compliance**    | Life safety and evacuation standards                       | AI with safety rulebook & standards database | - Compare with Preamble criteria (Sec. 0.1) <br> - Simulate emergency scenarios <br> - Red-flag detection                     |
| **QA-5: Traceability**         | Traceability & source referencing                          | AI-supported source-linking system           | - Auto-linking of internal chapter numbers <br> - Verification that all external sources are fully cited                      |
| **QA-6: Presentation Clarity** | Readability & audience fit                                 | Language model with audience profile         | - Adapt to pitch perspective <br> - Consistent formatting & terminology                                                       |

#### 8.4.5.3 AI-Assisted QA Pipeline

1. **Import**: New or changed documents are automatically loaded into the AI QA workflow.
2. **Pre-Check (Syntax & Structure)**: AI checks format, chapter numbering, and table integrity.
3. **Semantic Analysis**:

   * Cross-document check (e.g., material data in 2.2 vs. 7.2.1)
   * Alignment of numerical values and terminology
4. **Safety Simulation**: AI simulates scenarios (e.g., fire, radiation leak, pressure loss) based on Sec. 2.1.5 & 2.1.6, compares procedures with standards, and flags deviations.
5. **Issue Tagging**:

   * `CONTRADICTION` – conflicting information
   * `MISSING` – missing mandatory content
   * `PLACEHOLDER` – placeholder text without content
6. **QA Report**: Automatically generated table with:

   * Location (chapter, line)
   * QA category (see above)
   * AI recommendation for correction
7. **Review & Approval**: QA team reviews AI suggestions, confirms changes, and triggers versioning (Sec. 7.3).

#### 8.4.5.4 QA Table Format (Example)

| Chapter         | QA Note       | Description                                         | AI Recommendation                                 |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.2.4 vs. 7.2.1 | CONTRADICTION | SiC/SiC material density stated differently         | Use consistent values from material specification |
| 4.3.7 vs. 6.1.6 | MISSING       | Break-even calculation missing in expansion chapter | Insert figures from 4.3.7                         |
| 3.3.5           | PLACEHOLDER   | Communication channels not specified                | Add social media and educational platforms        |

---

#### 8.4.5.5 Safety-Specific QA Checkpoints

* **Technical Protection Systems**: Completeness of specifications (fire, radiation, meteoroids, biohazards)
* **Evacuation Logistics**: Pod capacity, access routes, drill frequency (Sec. 2.1.6)
* **Redundancy Checks**: Energy, life support, cooling
* **Auditability**: Safety protocols documented, verifiable, and versioned
* **Compliance**: Match with Preamble criteria & international safety standards

---

#### 8.4.5.6 Operational Implementation

* **Automation**: AI QA runs after every document change or before each release
* **Versioning**: Each QA-approved version stored with review date and result
* **Dashboards**: Live overview of open QA findings, safety status, and document maturity level
* **Lessons Learned**: AI analyzes recurring error types and proposes structural improvements
