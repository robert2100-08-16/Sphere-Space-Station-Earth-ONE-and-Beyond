### 8.4.3 Invitation to Participate – Research, Funding, Engineering, and Construction Partnership

The *Sphere Space Station Earth ONE & Beyond* project extends an open invitation to leading STEM institutions, the European Space Agency (ESA), universities, research organizations, and European companies to join in the exploration, funding, engineering, and construction of this landmark initiative.

**Our mission** is to create a sustainable, modular, and expandable orbital habitat that embodies scientific excellence, engineering innovation, and the shared values of the international community.  
**Your expertise** can directly contribute to key areas such as:

- **Scientific Research**: Space sciences, materials technology, life support systems, environmental monitoring.  
- **Engineering & Manufacturing**: High-performance composite materials, modular habitat construction, robotics, and automation for orbital assembly.  
- **Funding & Investment**: Public–private partnerships, technology development grants, and strategic capital for long-term infrastructure.  
- **Operational Development**: Training programs, safety standards, and integrated governance models.

#### Entry Requirement – The Preamble as a Binding Commitment
Participation in the *Sphere Space Station Earth ONE & Beyond* consortium requires **formal acknowledgement and acceptance of the project’s Preamble – Ethics & Security** as the binding foundation for all actions and decisions.  
This preamble establishes **respect for human dignity, peaceful and sustainable operations, democratic governance, transparency, and equitable access** as non-negotiable core principles. Adherence to these principles is the **mandatory “entry ticket”** for any partner, organization, or individual joining the project.

#### How to Join
Interested organizations are invited to submit an **Expression of Interest (EoI)** outlining their field of expertise, proposed contribution, and commitment to the Preamble’s principles. Following evaluation by the project’s Ethics Council and Consortium Board, selected partners will be formally integrated into the project roadmap.

By joining this initiative, you contribute to shaping a European-led, globally cooperative vision for sustainable human presence in space – setting a precedent for future generations both on Earth and beyond.
