# BL-ENG-E2-006 Habitat Expansion Path ("Earth TWO" Pre-Study)

- **Domain:** ENG
- **Program:** E2
- **EVOL Target:** EVOL-00
- **Status:** Draft

## Short Description & Business Value
Explore scalable habitat concepts that extend Earth ONE into a larger orbital settlement, evaluating options such as a second sphere, polar rings, or dock clusters to inform future "Earth TWO" development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Three scaling options analysed (second sphere, polar rings, dock cluster)
- Mass and power budgets for each option
- Estimated crew capacity increase for each scenario

## Dependencies / Cross-References
- Beyond program chapters

## Owner / Next Step / Target Date
- **Owner:** TBD
- **Next Step:** Trade Study
- **Target Date:** TBD

## Score & Risks
- **Score:** TBD (RICE/WSJF)
- **Risks:** Technological feasibility; cost scalability
