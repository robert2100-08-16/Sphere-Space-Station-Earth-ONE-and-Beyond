# 8.4.7 Appendix G: Backlog Potential Developments

This appendix consolidates potential developments across Governance, Outreach, Engineering, Science, Economics, and Operations. It serves as a living, prioritized repository that evolves independently of the main chapters, offering a stable and referenceable source for future work. Pointer subsections in the respective chapters link to the most relevant backlog items, keeping the primary narrative streamlined while enabling deeper exploration.

## Structure

1. **Scope & Maintenance** – outlines curation responsibilities, update cadence, and the definition of a "ready" item.
2. **Tagging & IDs**
   - `Domain:` `GOV` | `OPS` | `ENG` | `SCI` | `SOC` | `SEC` | `SUS` | `ECON`
   - `Program:` `E1` (Earth ONE) | `L1` (Lunar ONE) | `E2` (Earth TWO) | `B` (Beyond)
   - `Status:` `Idea` → `Draft` → `Exploration` → `Design` → `Pilot` → `Adopt`
   - `ID Schema:` `BL-<Domain>-<Program>-<NNN>` (e.g. `BL-ENG-E1-001`)
3. **Prioritization Method** – recommends using frameworks such as **RICE** or **WSJF**.
4. **Backlog List** – items are ordered by priority and follow the mini-template below.
5. **Change Log** – records when items are added or updated.

### Backlog Entry Mini-Template

- **ID / Title**
- **Domain / Program / EVOL Target**
- **Short Description & Business Value**
- **Acceptance Criteria**
- **Dependencies / Cross-References**
- **Owner / Next Step / Target Date Bucket**
- **Score & Risks**
