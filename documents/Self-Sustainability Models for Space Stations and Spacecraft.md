### **1. Models**

1. **Full Autonomous Sustainability**  
   - **Definition**: This model is designed for missions and stations that require complete independence from external support due to the extended mission duration and remoteness from supply chains. Resources must be renewable aboard, and robust nuclear energy backup systems are essential. Limited mining of non-renewable resources may be permitted for critical needs.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Resource Renewal**: All resources (air, water, food) are recycled and renewed on board.
     - **Energy Backup**: Equipped with nuclear energy systems for redundancy and reliability.
     - **Mining Permitted**: Non-renewable resource extraction is allowed as necessary to sustain mission goals.
   - **Suitable For**:
     - **Long-Duration Missions**: Missions > 12 months without access to resupply or station contact.
     - **Remote Stations**: Stations located in deep-space regions (e.g., Neptune and beyond, Asteroid Belt and beyond) where resupply is not feasible.
   - **Example Applications**:
     - **Exploration Kuiper ONE**: A 10-year mission to the Kuiper Belt, where self-sufficiency is essential due to extreme distance from resupply.
     - **Neptune ONE Station**: A science station in a stable orbit around Neptune, requiring total self-reliance for long-term exploration.

2. **Partial Autonomous Sustainability**  
   - **Definition**: Intended for missions and stations with some access to resupply but still needing a high degree of independence. Resources can be renewed on board, and a nuclear energy backup system is available for emergencies. Adequate mission resources are maintained on board, with limited mining as needed.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Resource Renewal**: Most critical resources can be recycled and renewed on board.
     - **Energy Backup**: Equipped with a nuclear or alternative energy backup system.
     - **Mining Permitted**: Limited mining of non-renewable resources is allowed to supplement supplies.
   - **Suitable For**:
     - **Medium-Duration Missions**: Missions where resupply is possible but may be infrequent.
     - **Less Remote Stations**: Stations located in regions where resupply from nearby planets or hubs is feasible (e.g., Mars, lunar orbit).
   - **Example Applications**:
     - **Mars Cycler**: A transport system operating on a stable cycler orbit between Earth and Mars, requiring sustainable life support and backup energy but with occasional resupply access.
     - **Belt Living ONE**: A station in the asteroid belt where occasional resupply from Mars or other locations is feasible but limited.

3. **Basic Autonomous Support**  
   - **Definition**: For missions and stations in closer proximity to Earth or other resupply hubs, this model allows for resource renewal aboard but relies on frequent resupply for critical mission resources. An energy backup system is present, though it may not require nuclear capability.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Resource Renewal**: Basic recycling systems for essential resources, with reliance on external resupply.
     - **Energy Backup**: Backup systems provided, typically non-nuclear, as resupply and emergency support are readily available.
     - **Mining Permitted**: Small-scale resource extraction allowed as needed.
   - **Suitable For**:
     - **Short-Duration Missions and Near-Planet Stations**: Missions with frequent resupply opportunities (e.g., LEO, lunar surface operations, Mars orbit).
     - **Local Transport Vessels**: Taxis, trucks, shuttles, and pods operating near planetary stations or within Earth-Moon space.
   - **Example Applications**:
     - **Earth ONE**: A multi-purpose space station in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with frequent resupply from Earth.
     - **Lunar Shuttles**: Transport vessels between Earth and lunar orbit that rely on Earth-based resupply.

| Model                       | Resource Renewal | Energy Backup              | Mining Allowed          | Typical Duration & Location                                  |

### **3. Discussion of Model Suitability and Practical Applications**

- **Full Autonomous Sustainability** is critical for the deepest space missions and stations, where distances and extended durations make regular resupply impossible. This model provides complete independence, suitable for ambitious exploration missions and habitats in regions like the Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, and beyond.

- **Partial Autonomous Sustainability** allows for high resilience while still relying on occasional resupply from closer bases. It strikes a balance between independence and practical support for missions around Mars, the Asteroid Belt, and near-lunar orbits, making it ideal for medium-term exploration missions.

- **Basic Autonomous Support** is appropriate for near-Earth or near-planet missions where resupply is frequent and reliable. This model fits within established Earth-Moon logistics, with Earth-based supply chains supporting low-risk, short-term missions. It suits commercial operations, transportation between stations, and short-stay habitats.

  - **Energy**: Nuclear fission or fusion reactors with redundant systems for extended missions.
  - **Resource Extraction**: Advanced robotic mining and processing systems for local resource utilization.
  - **Radiation Protection**: Enhanced radiation shielding due to extended exposure in deep space.

  - **Resource Extraction**: Minimal mining capabilities, focusing on emergency resource collection.
  - **Radiation Protection**: Basic shielding suitable for near-Earth or short-duration missions.

### **5. Environmental and Safety Considerations**

Each sustainability model must incorporate safety protocols and environmental standards to minimize impact on space environments:

- **Waste Management**: Efficient handling and disposal systems to prevent space debris accumulation and ensure safe waste processing, especially for long-term missions.
- **Environmental Impact**: Avoid contamination of celestial bodies and follow planetary protection protocols, particularly for mining and resource extraction.
- **Radiation Protection**: Enhanced shielding and radiation protection protocols are critical for Full Autonomous Sustainability missions due to increased exposure in deep space.
- **Safety Protocols**: Emergency response systems, such as escape pods or safe zones, should be implemented based on mission duration and distance from resupply sources.

Each model will be phased in according to current technological readiness and the mission requirements:

- **Phase I (0-5 Years)**: 
  - **Deploy Basic Autonomous Support** for near-Earth stations, lunar missions, and Earth-Moon transport vessels.
  - **Develop Partial Autonomous Sustainability** systems to support Mars-bound missions and nearby exploration efforts.

- **Phase II (5-15 Years)**:
