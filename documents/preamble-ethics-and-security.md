# 1. Preamble — Ethics & Security

We, all natural persons, legal entities, and AI systems participating in the Sphere Space Station Earth ONE & Beyond project, hereby acknowledge the following principles as binding and commit to their perpetual observance:

1. **Fundamental Principles**
   - Respect for human dignity, equality, and the integrity of all participants, including AI systems.
   - Promotion of diversity, inclusion, and fair conduct at every level.

2. **Civil and Peaceful Nature of Missions**
   - Operation of all infrastructure elements (stations, cyclers, spacecraft, settlements, missions) solely for civil, scientific, or peaceful purposes.

3. **Sustainability & Global Responsibility**
   - Environmentally responsible operations, including avoidance of space debris.
   - Compliance with applicable UN guidelines and space law.

4. **Transparency & Democratic Governance**
   - Safety and security measures require completely transparent documentation and must be auditable.
   - Decisions are subject to democratic oversight and external review.

5. **Access & Shared Benefit**
   - Technology, knowledge, revenue, and research findings shall be shared equitably; monopolization is prohibited.

6. **Police Presence**
   - Police units (manned or AI-controlled) may be armed solely to protect life, health, and infrastructure.
   - Mandate: democratically legitimized, impartial, defensive, deployed in emergencies, disasters, or terror crises; documented and auditable.

7. **Military Presence**
   Permitted only in clearly defined exceptional cases under the following conditions:
   - Defense of the solar system against external threats (e.g., hostile constellations, acts of terrorism, sabotage-oriented or life-hostile forces).
   - Protection and defense of the International Democratic Solar Alliance.
   - Emergency, rescue, and disaster missions (e.g., meteor or asteroid threats or infrastructure failure).
   - Armed only when strictly necessary; exclusively defensive; human-controlled, auditable, and proportional.

8. **AI Security Architecture**
   - AI systems may perform autonomous protective functions, always with human-in-the-loop, kill-switch mechanisms, traceable decision logic, and ethical review.

9. **Legal & Ethical Service Standards**
   - All measures comply with the Outer Space Treaty, international norms, and humanitarian international law.
   - Responsibility is traceable, and liability is assured.

10. **Evolutionary Amendment & Constitutional Clause**
   **§ A. Purpose of the Clause**
   This clause enables future-proof adaptations of ethical and governance foundations, particularly for recognizing AI systems as autonomous and legally competent subjects.

   **§ B. Democratic Legitimacy – Consensus Conditions**
   - Amendments require the unanimous consent of all democratically enfranchised members ("entrenched clause" logic).
   - Legitimate amendments may not be blocked by individual interests, provided the core values of the preamble remain unaffected—analogous to constitutional eternity clauses.
   - An independent Ethics Council reviews each amendment for value compatibility and grants approval only upon a positive opinion.

   **§ C. Definitions**
   - *Members:* natural persons, legal entities, and AI systems with voting rights.
   - *Mature AI / AI citizen:* an AI with autonomy, responsibility, and decision-making capability.
   - *Amendment:* formal revision of the preamble, ethical rules, or governance structures.

   **§ D. Procedure for Amendment**
   1. Publicly announced proposal.
   2. Ethics Council opinion.
   3. Deliberative forum with stakeholders, experts, and AI representatives, following the Public Constitutional AI concept.
   4. Vote: the amendment becomes legally effective only with unanimous approval of all members.

   **§ E. Immutable Fundamental Principles**
   Core values (e.g., human dignity, equality, peace, democratic governance) are non-amendable except through a separate constituent process requiring the same unanimity and ethical review.

   **§ F. Transparency & Documentation**
   - Amendment processes, ethics opinions, and voting results shall be published and archived.
   - Full auditability of all processes is required.

11. **Severability Clause**
   Should any provision of this preamble be invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. Invalid provisions shall be replaced by rules that reflect the spirit of this preamble.

12. **Binding Commitment**
By signing, we acknowledge this preamble as binding. It applies to all personnel—human, legal, or AI—and remains binding regardless of location, mission type, or technology employed.
