### **Visionary Proposal for the Sphere Space Station Network**

**Date: 2024-12-05**

#### **Introduction**

The Sphere Space Station Network represents a groundbreaking initiative to establish sustainable human presence in space. This visionary project includes the development of Earth ONE in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Lunar ONE in lunar orbit, with plans for further expansion into deep space. The network aims to advance scientific research, promote international cooperation, and drive economic growth through space-based industries.
The Sphere Space Station concept is a rotating 127 Meter Diameter Sphere with 16 coaxial cylindric decks with different artificial gravity through the rotational forces with a 20 Meter space open wormhole Docking Bay for Space crafts and robotic space vehicles.

#### **Earth ONE**

**Purpose**: Science, Living, Working, Tourism  
**Location**: Low Earth Orbit (LEO)  
**Focus**: Earth ONE serves as a multi-purpose hub for scientific research, industry, tourism, and as a foundational model for other Sphere Stations. Key activities include satellite servicing, microgravity research, and space tourism.  
**Capacity**: Up to 700 occupants, with a focus on modularity for long-term expansion.  
**Energy Supply**: Combination of solar panels and nuclear reactors, with integrated cooling systems and heat exchangers to dissipate excess heat efficiently.

#### **Lunar ONE**

**Purpose**: Science, Living, Working, Recreation Location for Moonworker, Tourism  
**Location**: Elliptic Moon Orbit  
**Focus**: Supports lunar exploration, research, and mining operations. A critical base for lunar resource extraction and logistics for missions to Mars and beyond.  
**Capacity**: Designed for 400â€“500 occupants, equipped for lunar material handling and processing.  
**Energy Supply**: Solar arrays and nuclear reactors to ensure reliable power with adequate shielding and cooling.

#### **Beyond**

**Future Expansion**: The Sphere Station Network envisions further expansion into deep space, including asteroid belt stations and Mars orbiters, to support long-duration missions and interplanetary travel. These stations will act as logistical hubs, research outposts, and industrial centers, driving the next phase of human space exploration.

#### **Conclusion**

The Sphere Space Station Network is poised to revolutionize human presence in space, fostering scientific innovation, economic development, and international collaboration. By investing in this visionary project, the EU can lead the way in sustainable space exploration and secure its position at the forefront of the space economy.
