# A. Appendix A: Window Specification and Material Selection of LEO-based Earth ONE Station

**High-Performance Composite Window for Space Applications: Material and Specification Overview**

## A.1 Introduction

The selection of materials for the windows of the Earth ONE station demands an extraordinary level of durability. These windows are subject to extreme temperature fluctuations, rapid decompression, impacts from micrometeorites, and high levels of UV and cosmic radiation. The proposed composite window uses a multi-layered construction designed to withstand these conditions, ensuring optical clarity and maximum protection.
