# 1. Deck Concept of the Sphere Space Station Earth ONE

## 1.1 Realistic Volume Calculation and Deck Allocation

### 1.1.1 1.1 Volume Breakdown per Deck

Updated breakdown of deck functions, with consideration for energy generation and cooling needs:

1. **Living/Residential Areas**: Decks 006–010, with 1 g gravity for residential stability.
2. **Hospitality/Recreation Areas**: Decks 007–009, with recreational amenities for crew well-being.
3. **Agricultural Areas**: Decks 005 and 011, with optimized sunlight exposure and gravity for agriculture.
4. **Propulsion Room**: Centralized on Decks 000–001 for optimal balance.
5. **Energy Supply**:
   - **Nuclear Reactors**: Located on Deck 015, with integrated shielding and cooling near the outer hull.
   - **Solar Panels**: Mounted on outer hull above Deck 12, covering non-windowed sections for maximum efficiency.
6. **Life Support System Room**: Decks 002–003, with recycling systems and emergency air/water storage.
7. **Command Room**: Deck 008 for centralized operations.
8. **Operational Areas**: Decks 004 and 009 for administration and support functions.
9. **Research Areas**: Decks 010–012 for laboratories and scientific spaces.
10. **Educational Spaces**: Deck 013, with classrooms and facilities for younger occupants.
11. **Kindergarten and Play Spaces**: Deck 013, adjacent to educational spaces.
12. **Workspaces**: Deck 014 for manufacturing, repair, and maintenance.
13. **Fuel Storage Room**: Deck 015, isolated from living areas for safety.
14. **Community Spaces**: Decks 006–007, for communal dining and events.
15. **Medical Facilities**: Deck 012 with full healthcare services.
16. **Hazard Management Rooms**: Deck 015 for emergency response systems.
17. **Escape Pod Areas**: Strategically located across multiple decks.

### 1.1.2 1.2 Volume Calculations and Net Space by Function
