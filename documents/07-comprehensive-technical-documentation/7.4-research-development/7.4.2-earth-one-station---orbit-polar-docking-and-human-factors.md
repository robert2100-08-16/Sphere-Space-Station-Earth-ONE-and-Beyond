### 7.4.2 Earth ONE Station: Orbit, Polar Docking, and Human Factors

#### 7.4.2.1 Earth ONE in Low Earth Orbit vs. Higher Orbits (GEO, Lagrange)

##### 7.4.2.1.1 Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
The **Earth ONE** space station is located in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [^1]. In LEO, it circles the Earth in about **90 minutes**, resulting in **16 sunrises and sunsets per day**. Proximity to Earth eases resupply and communication (minimal signal delay), but the environment is harsh:  
– Residual atmosphere (drag) → regular orbital corrections required  
– Increased risk from space debris  
– The Earth's magnetic field offers some radiation protection by deflecting part of cosmic rays and solar particles

##### 7.4.2.1.2 Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
At roughly **36,000 km altitude**, a station moves synchronously with Earth's rotation, remaining over the same point on the surface. Advantages:  
– Continuous line-of-sight to ground stations  
– No atmospheric drag  
Disadvantages:  
– Higher radiation levels (outside dense magnetic field protection)  
– Resupply and evacuation are more complex (more fuel, longer flight times)  
– Artificial day-night regulation required (nearly constant sunlight)

##### 7.4.2.1.3 Lagrange Points
Stations at **Lagrange points** (e.g., Earth–Moon L1/L2 or Earth–Sun L2) remain in quasi-stable positions. Advantages:  
– Favorable gravitational equilibrium  
– Unobstructed deep space view  
Disadvantages:  
– Little to no natural radiation protection  
– Large distance → long communication delays and return times  
– Regular orbital station-keeping required

##### 7.4.2.1.4 Distant Orbits (Asteroid Belt)
Long-term plans include **Belt ONE** in the Asteroid Belt [^2]. Challenges:  
– High degree of self-sufficiency required  
– Extreme radiation, no planetary gravity  
– Reduced solar energy availability  
– Very long travel times (decades)

#### 7.4.2.2 "Bus Terminal" Polar Docking Concept

**Earth ONE** (rotating spherical station, ~127 m diameter) features a **20 m wide central docking tunnel** along its rotational axis [^3].  
Concept:  
– **Arrival pole** for incoming shuttles  
– **Departure pole** for outbound shuttles  
– Benefits: easy approach, separated traffic flow, energy efficiency

**Crew Logistics:**  
– Arrival and departure separated → operational relief  
– Central unloading/loading on **Deck 000** [^5][^6], distribution via radial elevators [^7]

#### 7.4.2.3 Rotation Direction and Planetary Analogies

– **Prograde rotation** (like Earth) preferred → gyroscopic stability, consistent approach patterns [^8]  
– **Retrograde rotation** (like Venus) possible, but rarely practical [^9][^10]  
– **Axial tilt** affects solar exposure and stability, may require active attitude control [^11]

---

#### 7.4.2.4 Rotational Stability and Attitude Control

– Spin rate: approx. **4–5 rpm** → ~1g on outer decks [^12][^13]  
– Stabilization via reaction wheels, control moment gyros [^14], electric thrusters [^15]  
– Docking along the rotation axis minimizes changes to angular momentum  
– Orbital reboosts (in LEO) required periodically  
– Navigation lights can be dynamically controlled to indicate correct orientation despite rotation

#### 7.4.2.5 Physical, Psychological, and Social Effects on the Crew

##### 7.4.2.5.1 Physical Effects
– Artificial gravity prevents bone and muscle loss  
– Noticeable gravity gradient within the station  
– Coriolis effects require adaptation (possible space motion sickness)  
– Adaptation likely within a few days

##### 7.4.2.5.2 Orientation and Perception
– Clearly defined "up/down" (radial) direction  
– Differences between spinward and counter-spinward movement  
– Window placement and interior design must support orientation [^16][^17]

##### 7.4.2.5.3 Psychological Aspects
– Proximity to Earth → sense of connection  
– Artificial day-night cycle to stabilize circadian rhythm  
– Large communal spaces and varied leisure options to counter isolation

##### 7.4.2.5.4 Social Dynamics
– Up to 700 inhabitants [^18] → small-town-like structure  
– Language and culture adapt to rotational environment  
– Integration through shared activities and rituals

---

**Summary:**  
Earth ONE combines innovative orbital and docking strategies with human-centered interior and operational design. The choice of orbit, polar docking architecture, rotational configuration, and psychological as well as social design are key to making the long-term operation of a large rotating space station a success.
