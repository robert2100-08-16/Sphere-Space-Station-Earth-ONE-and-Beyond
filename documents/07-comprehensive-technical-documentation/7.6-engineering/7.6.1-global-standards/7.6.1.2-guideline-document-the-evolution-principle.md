## 7.6.1.2 Guideline Document: The Evolution Principle

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** DRAFT

> Purpose: Make **Evolution (EVOL)** the primary internal and external identifier, organizing principle, and strategic driver. Ensure every stakeholder—engineering, operations, finance, partners, and customers—can see, audit, and plan around product generations.

---

### 1) Scope & Intent

This principle applies to all systems, subsystems, artifacts, and communications across the Sphere project. It operationalizes **Evolution‑first**: product generations (**EVOL‑00, EVOL‑01, …**) are self‑contained, auditable capsules that structure work, govern change, and frame expectations.

**Outcomes sought:**

* **Visibility:** Evolution state is instantly discoverable in code, docs, UI, packaging, and public comms.
* **Order:** Generations partition architectural eras; within a generation, SemVer governs compatible change.
* **Drive:** Generational goals and exit criteria create focus, motivate delivery, and anchor roadmaps.

---

### 2) What “Evolution” Means

**EVOL‑XX = Product Generation.**

* **Boundary:** A generation encapsulates architecture, interfaces, verification, and operations for its era.
* **Break rule:** A **system‑wide architectural break** opens a **new EVOL**. Within an EVOL, incompatible but scoped changes may increment **MAJOR** (SemVer) without starting a new generation.
* **Artifacts per EVOL:** Charter, architecture/ADR index, specs & ICDs, tests/V\&V, ops & SOPs, change log, release notes, migration guides, marketing copy, and a signed manifest.

**SemVer inside an EVOL:**

* **MAJOR:** Incompatible change **scoped to the EVOL** (e.g., an ICD break that does not require a new architecture era).
* **MINOR:** Backward‑compatible additions.
* **PATCH:** Editorial/non‑semantic fixes.

---

### 3) Why Evolution‑first (Vision)

1. **Internal compass.** Generations focus teams on a clear goal line (“What ships in EVOL‑01?”), simplify trade‑offs, and enable parallel work on EVOL‑N and EVOL‑(N+1).

2. **External signal.** Generations are a **customer‑facing identity** (like automotive model generations) that set expectations about capability, compatibility, and support windows.

3. **Audit & trust.** Each EVOL is an auditable capsule—design, tests, operations—supporting certifications, safety reviews, and partner due diligence.

4. **Strategic cadence.** Generational milestones drive funding gates, supplier readiness, and ecosystem planning.

---

### 4) Core Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Badge the generation everywhere.** Use EVOL labels in filenames, repo paths, binaries, UI About screens, dashboards, API headers, contracts, and marketing.
2. **One EVOL, one SSOT per topic.** Each topic has exactly one APPROVED reference document per EVOL.
3. **New EVOL on architectural break.** If compatibility cannot be maintained across the system boundary (architecture, safety, ops doctrine), you must open **EVOL‑(N+1)**.
4. **Freeze, then fork forward.** Freeze EVOL‑N (read‑only, patch‑only) and develop EVOL‑(N+1) in a separate capsule. No silent backports across EVOLs.
5. **Traceability is mandatory.** Every artifact in an EVOL links to its RFC/ADR/CR and V\&V evidence.

---

### 5) Lifecycle & Visibility

**Lifecycle:** Initiate → Work → Release → Freeze & Archive.

* **Initiate:** Write the *EVOL Charter* (scope, goals, compatibility promises, risks, exit criteria). Appoint owners and reviewers.
* **Work:** Produce and evolve all artifacts under `…/7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX/` with CI linting and manifesting.
* **Release:** Tag `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM`, publish release notes and migration guides, update customer‑facing materials.
* **Freeze & Archive:** Move to `…/7.6.3-history/` (read‑only). Security and legal notices may update; functionality does not.

**Visibility mechanisms (required):**

* **current‑evolution.md** pointer in the evolutions root.
* **EVOL banner** in user‑facing UIs and operational dashboards.
* **Compare pages**: automated diffs EVOL‑(N‑1) ↔ EVOL‑N for key specs and ICDs.
* **Roadmap strip**: Now (EVOL‑N), Next (EVOL‑N+1), Later (N+2) on the program home page.

---

### 6) External Identity (Customer‑Facing)

**Generation labeling:**

* Public names include the generation, e.g., *Sphere Earth ONE — EVOL‑01*.
* Marketing and documentation lead with the EVOL identity; model‑year‑style messaging communicates evolution (capabilities, safety level, performance).

**Promises per EVOL:**

* **Compatibility window:** the minimum duration interfaces will be supported.
* **Support policy:** LTS/maintenance timelines per EVOL.
* **Migration path:** customer‑ready guides and tooling from EVOL‑(N‑1) to EVOL‑N.

**Automotive analogy (informative):** Like BMW model generations, each EVOL is a visible chapter with distinct architecture and capabilities, while trims/options map to MINOR/PATCH evolution within the generation.

---

### 7) Governance & Decision Criteria

**When to open a new EVOL:**

* Cross‑cutting architectural changes (safety doctrine, structural grid, power topology, thermal envelope, life‑support primitives).
* Interface breaks that cannot be shimmied without unacceptable cost or risk.
* Operational model change (e.g., new docking paradigm) that invalidates prior procedures.

**Gatekeeping:**

* Changes proposing a new EVOL require an **RFC** with impact analysis, migration plan, and customer‑facing narrative. A cross‑discipline board reviews (Architecture, Safety, Ops, Finance, Programs).

**Within‑EVOL change:**

* Use SemVer and ADR/RFC discipline; default to compatibility, prefer additive designs, and provide deprecation schedules.

---

### 8) Artifacts & Templates (per EVOL)

**Required:**

* **EVOL Charter** (scope, goals, risks, exit criteria).
* **Architecture overview** + **ADR index**.
* **SPEC/ICD set** with traceability to requirements and tests.
* **V\&V plan & reports**; acceptance evidence.
* **Ops handbook & SOPs**; safety dossier.
* **Change log & release notes**; **migration guide**.
* **Signed manifest** of key artifacts with checksums; EVOL tag.

**Template snippets (short):**

**EVOL Charter (outline)**

1. Scope & goals (what this generation must deliver)
2. Compatibility promises (what remains stable; for how long)
3. Risks & mitigations (top 5)
4. Exit criteria for freeze (objective tests & evidence)
5. Timeline: milestones to Release & Freeze

**Migration Guide (outline)**

1. Audience & prerequisites
2. What changed and why
3. Compatibility matrix (old ↔ new)
4. Step‑by‑step migration
5. Validation checklist & rollback

---

### 9) Foldering, Naming & CI Hooks (Summary)

* **Foldering:** Each EVOL lives under `7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX/…`; frozen generations move to `7.6.3-history/EVOL-XX/…`.
* **Naming:** File names carry `<DOC>-<EVOL>-…-v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>-<STATE>.md`. EVOL in path **must** match filename.
* **CI Hooks:** Lint filename ↔ front‑matter coherence; generate EVOL tags and manifests; auto‑publish compare pages and release notes; block merges on missing RFC/ADR links.

---

### 10) KPIs & Rituals

**KPIs:**

* Generation goal completion rate (per milestone).
* Interface stability index (breaks avoided vs proposed).
* Migration lead time for key partners.
* Documentation completeness (SSOT coverage) at Release.

**Rituals:**

* **EVOL Review** (bi‑weekly): status, risks, decision log.
* **Interface Council** (monthly): compatibility & deprecations.
* **Freeze Readiness Review** (gate): verify exit criteria, lock manifests.
* **Customer Briefing** (at Release): public notes, support window, migration aids.

---

### 11) Non‑Goals (to avoid confusion)

* EVOL is **not** a marketing‑only label; it reflects real architectural eras.
* EVOL does **not** replace SemVer; it **frames** SemVer within a generation.
* EVOL changes do **not** rewrite history; prior EVOLs remain frozen and auditable.

---

### 12) Appendix – Quick Reference

**Open new EVOL if:** architecture or ops doctrine changes system‑wide; interfaces cannot be compatibly bridged; safety basis or certification envelope resets.

**Stay within EVOL if:** change is additive or can be shimmed; risk and cost of migration exceed benefit; safety and ops doctrine remain stable.

**Always do:** badge the generation, keep one SSOT per topic per EVOL, trace every change, publish migration paths, and freeze the past before building the future.
