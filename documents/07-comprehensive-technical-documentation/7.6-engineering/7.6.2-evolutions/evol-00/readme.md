# EVOLUTION 00 — The Beginning

> “700 pioneers. First light on the ring. We are writing the birth certificate of a city in orbit.”

EVOL00 is our first visible chapter: a minimal, end-to-end **working baseline** that proves the architecture in the real world. It is small by design, complete by necessity, and **auditable by default**. EVOL00 establishes the language of the system—structural grid, core interfaces, safety assumptions, and the build-test-operate chain—and makes **Evolution** the primary beacon, clear to team, partners, and users.

Success here isn’t feature breadth; it’s **trust**: a reproducible capsule that can be built, tested, operated, and learned from. When EVOL00 closes, we freeze a clean, signed baseline and open EVOL01 with confidence and velocity.

**Focus:** Clarity over scope · Safety over speed · Evidence over claims · Visibility everywhere.
