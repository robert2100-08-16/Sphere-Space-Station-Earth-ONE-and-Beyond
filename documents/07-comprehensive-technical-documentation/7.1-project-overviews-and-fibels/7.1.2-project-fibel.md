### 7.1.2 Project Fibel

#### 7.1.2.1 Summary

This Project Fibel conveys the "Good Karma" spirit that sustains long missions and guides difficult choices. It encourages teams to act with resilience, integrity, and foresight so that every decision contributes to the shared goal of building a sustainable presence in space. Although the documentation is already extensive, the project remains open to deeper logistical plans, richer governance models, and new social or technical modules. Each addition should integrate holistically—linking technology, humanity, economy, and environment—while preserving the modular structure that allows the vision to grow without losing its core identity.
