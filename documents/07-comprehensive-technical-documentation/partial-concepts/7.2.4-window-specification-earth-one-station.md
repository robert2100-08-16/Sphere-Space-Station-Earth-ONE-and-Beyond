# 7.2.4 Window Specification Earth ONE Station

The Earth ONE station requires windows that withstand extreme thermal cycling, rapid decompression, micrometeorite impacts, and intense UV and cosmic radiation. A multi-layered composite structure is proposed:

- **Outer Layer**: Aluminum Oxide or ALON, 5 cm thick, providing hardness and UV resistance.
- **Middle Layers**: 10 cm fused silica for thermal stability and UV shielding, plus 5 cm polycarbonate for shock absorption.
- **Inner Layer**: 3 cm borosilicate or cerium-doped glass for radiation protection and optical clarity.

Total thickness is approximately 20–30 cm with a weight of 530–550 kg/m², offering superior resilience for the LEO environment.
