# Blender Hull Simulation

This folder contains a minimal Blender Python script that generates a simple hull model for the Sphere Station. It mirrors the approach of the deck simulation but focuses solely on the outer hull.

* **blender_hull_simulator.py** – Creates a basic hull based on `deck_3d_construction_data.csv`.
* **blender_starter.py** – Convenience launcher that starts Blender using the environment variable `BLENDER_PATH`.
