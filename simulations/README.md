# Simulations

This folder hosts example scripts and data used to generate visualizations for the Sphere Station project.

The `deck_calculator` subdirectory exposes `deck_calculations_script.py` as a lightweight wrapper around the reusable library.

`blender_deck_simulator` and `blender_hull_simulation` provide example Blender scripts for visualising the decks and the outer hull respectively.
