# Simulations

This folder hosts example scripts and data used to generate visualizations for the Sphere Station project.

The `scripts` subdirectory contains the Python module `deck_calculations_script.py`, which builds geometry for the rotating sphere station and renders animations.

`blender_simulation` and `blender_hull_simulation` provide example Blender scripts for visualizing the decks and the outer hull respectively.
