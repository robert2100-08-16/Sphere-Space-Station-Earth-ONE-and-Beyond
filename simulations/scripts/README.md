# Simulation Scripts

This directory contains the `deck_calculations_script.py` module along with generated animations and data.

The script calculates deck geometry, window placement, and hull properties of the Sphere Station. Animations can be generated to visualize deck rotation and gravity zones.

Generated frame images are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
