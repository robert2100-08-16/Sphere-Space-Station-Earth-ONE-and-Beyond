# 1. Simulation Results

This directory stores generated artefacts from the sphere station
simulations.  Besides HTML animations it now also contains geometry
exports such as a base64-encoded STEP model and glTF files produced by the
prototype exporters.
These files can be used to inspect the station model in external CAD or
3D viewers.
