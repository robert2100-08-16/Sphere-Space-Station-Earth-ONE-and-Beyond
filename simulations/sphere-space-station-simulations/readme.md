# Sphere Space Station Simulations Library

This package bundles the core calculations, animation helpers and data export functionality used by the example simulations.  It is organised into subpackages:

```
geometry/   - core classes such as ``SphereDeckCalculator``
reporting/  - CSV/HTML export utilities
animation/  - functions producing Matplotlib animations
```

The modules here can be reused by the thin adapters located in the individual simulation folders.
