### 2.1.1 **Geometry, Dynamics, and Structural Layout**

The 127-meter Sphere Station is a spherical, rotating structure designed to provide artificial gravity through centrifugal force. The station has a diameter of 127 meters and rotates along a central axis to simulate gravity on its decks.

\newpage

### 7.4.1 Sphere Station Simulator – Research Summary

Here is a structured summary of key findings from engineering, social psychological, and medical literature relevant to further development of the Sphere Station Simulator. The compilation draws on internal project documents and external research sources.

---

#### 7.4.1.1 🛠️ Engineering Aspects

##### 7.4.1.1.1 Artificial gravity and structure

* **Rotation radius and speed:** For artificial gravity without gravitational load on the body, the station radius must be large enough. Studies show that with radii under 56 m a large gravity gradient between head and feet occurs, and rotation speeds over 4 rpm trigger motion sickness. With a Sphere Station diameter of 127 m and Deck 8 as the "Earth deck," these limits are met.
* **Expandable modules:** Modern concepts propose building the station from concentric cylinders that can be expanded stepwise. This allows the living area to grow without interrupting systems. Tensegrity structures offer a flexible and lightweight construction for such modules.
* **Radiation protection:** Interplanetary missions require effective shielding against cosmic radiation and solar particles. A shield made from 5 m of regolith and water, which also serves as a heat store, can protect the crew and improve thermal management. Solar cells on the shield provide additional energy.
* **Agriculture and living space:** Concept studies budget around 300 m² of agricultural area per inhabitant; only at an outer radius of about 224 m would there be enough area for 8,000 people. The Sphere Station instead relies on hydroponic gardens and aeroponics on the Earth deck.

##### 7.4.1.1.2 Subsystems and infrastructure (internal documents)

* **Access and transport:** In addition to passenger and cargo elevators, heavy freight lifts, tangential conveyor belts/rail vehicles, and hover/climbing channels are proposed.
* **Energy and heat:** Primary supply via two NuScale SMR reactors or an array of microreactors; large solar panel fields; liquid heat stores (e.g., molten salt) and deployable radiators; battery banks and flywheels for load peaks.
* **Safety & emergency:** Inert gas and water mist fire-suppression systems, radiation shielding walls, meteoroid protection layers, and evacuation capsules.
* **Docking & logistics:** Central docking port on Deck 0, cargo and waste bays, and shuttle systems for transfers between Earth, LEO, and long-range missions.
* **Control & propulsion:** Gyroscopes/flywheels for attitude control and electric thrusters for orbital corrections.
* **Life support:** Closed air, water, and waste cycles as well as a high-speed data network.
* **Additional facilities:** Hydroponics/aeroponics, medical centers, recreation and learning areas, and recycling and industrial laboratories.

These subsystems should be available as optional modules in the full simulator to keep the model realistic and configurable.

---

#### 7.4.1.2 🧠 Social Psychological Findings

##### 7.4.1.2.1 Team dynamics in isolated, long-duration missions

* **Less social time and early conflicts:** In analogs to long-duration missions (e.g., Antarctic stations, Mars habitats) teams tend to spend less social time together over longer missions; efficiency usually remains constant, but by day 90 every team has experienced at least one conflict.
* **Communication and mood:** Commanders reduce written communication with mission control over time, and mood-related "third-quarter phenomena" (mid-mission crises) do not appear consistently.
* **Isolation and monotonous routines:** The Team Self-Maintenance (TSM) study emphasizes that monotonous routines, a "Groundhog Day" feeling, and lack of novelty lead to boredom, frustration, and psychological strain. Without external feedback, crews may develop apathy and emotional problems.
* **Team Self-Maintenance:** Long missions require strategies in which teams actively maintain their psychological health. Key processes include information exchange, self-regulation, resource recovery, and emotional support. Research recommends prioritizing team well-being alongside performance goals and developing measures for conflict prevention and resolution.
* **Implications for design:** Spaces should be designed to offer variety, privacy, and communal areas. Interactive leisure offerings (e.g., VR training, gardens) and mood-enhancing elements contribute to psychological stability.

##### 7.4.1.2.2 Crew management and psychological research

* **Selection & preparation:** Successful missions require a balanced team with respect to personality, culture, hierarchy sensitivity, and resilience. Training in conflict management, cultural competence, and stress coping is essential.
* **Research gaps:** Long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit (Mars) need more empirical data; analog studies so far provide only limited quantitative statements about team cohesion and performance.

---

#### 7.4.1.3 🧬 Medical and Physiological Aspects

##### 7.4.1.3.1 Effects of microgravity

* **Bone density loss and muscle atrophy:** Without gravity, load-bearing bones lose **1% to 1.5% mineral content per month** on average; muscles atrophy faster than on Earth. Rehabilitation does not fully restore bone density.
* **Fluid shifts and kidney stones:** Bodily fluids shift toward the head, increasing intraocular pressure and possibly causing vision problems. Dehydration and calcium excretion raise the risk of kidney stones.
* **Countermeasures:** Leg compression and lower-body negative pressure suits help redistribute fluids. Medications such as **potassium citrate** and **bisphosphonates** are used to prevent kidney stones and bone loss. Regular **aerobic and resistive exercise** keeps the heart, bones, and muscles healthy and improves mood; artificial gravity (short-arm centrifuges) is being explored as an additional measure.
* **Immune system and microbiome:** Isolation and microgravity alter the immune system and encourage microorganism transmission; NASA monitors air quality, enforces hygiene protocols, and recommends flu vaccination and pre-launch quarantine.
* **Habitability:** For psychological health, living spaces must consider temperature fluctuations, noise, lighting, and confinement.

---

#### 7.4.1.4 🔗 Conclusions for the Full Simulator and Research

1. **Realistic modeling:** The simulator should account for radiation shielding, thermal management, rotation speeds, and expandable modules. A realistic deck layout (e.g., 16 decks with varying gravity) reflects internal documentation.
2. **Modular subsystems:** In addition to elevators, conveyor belts, fire barriers, and gyros, heavy cargo lifts, cargo bays, docking ports, reactors, heat storage, battery storage, evacuation capsules, and recycling plants should be integrated as optional modules.
3. **Psychological & social modules:** Long missions require spaces for retreat and community, leisure options (e.g., gardens, VR training), and mechanisms for team self-maintenance. The simulator can offer virtual scenarios for conflict training, information exchange, and TSM processes.
4. **Medical facilities:** Models of gyms, sick bays, hydroponic farms, and research laboratories reflect the requirements for health, nutrition, and life support. Measurement devices such as centrifuges or compression suits could also be digitally represented.

With these findings, upcoming developments (L4 sprint and beyond) can align with technical realism, social factors, and medical constraints. This enhances both the simulation's validity and its usefulness for engineering decisions and crew training.

### 7.4.2 Earth ONE Station: Orbit, Polar Docking, and Human Factors

#### 7.4.2.1 Earth ONE in Low Earth Orbit vs. Higher Orbits (GEO, Lagrange)

##### 7.4.2.1.1 Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
The **Earth ONE** space station is located in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [^1]. In LEO, it circles the Earth in about **90 minutes**, resulting in **16 sunrises and sunsets per day**. Proximity to Earth eases resupply and communication (minimal signal delay), but the environment is harsh:  
– Residual atmosphere (drag) → regular orbital corrections required  
– Increased risk from space debris  
– The Earth's magnetic field offers some radiation protection by deflecting part of cosmic rays and solar particles

##### 7.4.2.1.2 Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
At roughly **36,000 km altitude**, a station moves synchronously with Earth's rotation, remaining over the same point on the surface. Advantages:  
– Continuous line-of-sight to ground stations  
– No atmospheric drag  
Disadvantages:  
– Higher radiation levels (outside dense magnetic field protection)  
– Resupply and evacuation are more complex (more fuel, longer flight times)  
– Artificial day-night regulation required (nearly constant sunlight)

##### 7.4.2.1.3 Lagrange Points
Stations at **Lagrange points** (e.g., Earth–Moon L1/L2 or Earth–Sun L2) remain in quasi-stable positions. Advantages:  
– Favorable gravitational equilibrium  
– Unobstructed deep space view  
Disadvantages:  
– Little to no natural radiation protection  
– Large distance → long communication delays and return times  
– Regular orbital station-keeping required

##### 7.4.2.1.4 Distant Orbits (Asteroid Belt)
Long-term plans include **Belt ONE** in the Asteroid Belt [^2]. Challenges:  
– High degree of self-sufficiency required  
– Extreme radiation, no planetary gravity  
– Reduced solar energy availability  
– Very long travel times (decades)

---

#### 7.4.2.2 "Bus Terminal" Polar Docking Concept

**Earth ONE** (rotating spherical station, ~127 m diameter) features a **20 m wide central docking tunnel** along its rotational axis [^3].  
Concept:  
– **Arrival pole** for incoming shuttles  
– **Departure pole** for outbound shuttles

#### 7.4.2.3 Rotation Direction and Planetary Analogies

– **Prograde rotation** (like Earth) preferred → gyroscopic stability, consistent approach patterns [^8]  
– **Retrograde rotation** (like Venus) possible, but rarely practical [^9][^10]  
– **Axial tilt** affects solar exposure and stability, may require active attitude control [^11]

---

#### 7.4.2.4 Rotational Stability and Attitude Control

– Spin rate: approx. **4–5 rpm** → ~1g on outer decks [^12][^13]  
– Stabilization via reaction wheels, control moment gyros [^14], electric thrusters [^15]  
– Docking along the rotation axis minimizes changes to angular momentum  
– Orbital reboosts (in LEO) required periodically  
– Navigation lights can be dynamically controlled to indicate correct orientation despite rotation

---

#### 7.4.2.5 Physical, Psychological, and Social Effects on the Crew

##### 7.4.2.5.1 Physical Effects
– Artificial gravity prevents bone and muscle loss  
– Noticeable gravity gradient within the station  
– Coriolis effects require adaptation (possible space motion sickness)  
– Adaptation likely within a few days

##### 7.4.2.5.2 Orientation and Perception
– Clearly defined "up/down" (radial) direction  
– Differences between spinward and counter-spinward movement  
– Window placement and interior design must support orientation [^16][^17]

##### 7.4.2.5.3 Psychological Aspects
– Proximity to Earth → sense of connection  
– Artificial day-night cycle to stabilize circadian rhythm  
– Large communal spaces and varied leisure options to counter isolation

##### 7.4.2.5.4 Social Dynamics
– Up to 700 inhabitants [^18] → small-town-like structure  
– Language and culture adapt to rotational environment  
– Integration through shared activities and rituals

---

**Summary:**  
Earth ONE combines innovative orbital and docking strategies with human-centered interior and operational design. The choice of orbit, polar docking architecture, rotational configuration, and psychological as well as social design are key to making the long-term operation of a large rotating space station a success.

```

Each EVOL folder carries the same skeleton so artifacts are predictable and traceable.

---

## File naming & versioning (must-do)

Use the governed pattern from *Global Standards*:

```
<DOC-TYPE>-<EVOL>-<DISC>-<DOMAIN>-<ID>-<subject>-<LANG>-v<SemVer>-<STATE>.md
```

**Example** (already in this repo):
`SPEC-00-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001-wormhole-docking-tunnel-EN-v0.1.0-DRAFT`
Where:

* `DOC-TYPE` = SPEC/RFC/ICD/TEST/OPS…
* `EVOL` = two digits (e.g., 00)
* `DISC` = discipline tag (e.g., STR, THM, ECLSS, GNC)
* `SemVer` = `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
* `STATE` = DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → FROZEN (plus DEPRECATED when retired)

Front-matter is **required** (owner, reviewers, EVOL, discipline, status, links to requirements/tests). CI will block missing or malformed headers.

---

## Evolution lifecycle & phase gates

We design **coarse → fine**, proving feasibility early, then tightening evidence through gates. Typical gates used across EVOLs:

* **SRR** – System Requirements Review
* **SDR/AR** – Architecture Review
* **PDR** – Preliminary Design Review
* **CDR** – Critical Design Review
* **TRR** – Test Readiness Review
* **QR/FAR** – Qualification / Flight Acceptance Review
* **ORR** – Operations Readiness Review

Each gate has minimal deliverables (documents, models, tests, checklists) defined in *Evolution Deliverables & Phase Gates*. Merge is blocked until the gate’s checklist is satisfied.

---

## CI, quality gates, and merge blockers

Every PR runs automated checks for:

* Filename & front-matter schema compliance
* Link integrity & cross-references
* Glossary/abbreviation use
* Lint/format rules per document type
* Required attachments (evidence, ICDs, test matrices) for the current gate

Failing any check blocks merge. Owners/Reviewers enforce additional domain-specific criteria as defined in `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Working in an EVOL

1. Start with the EVOL’s `readme.md` to confirm scope and open questions.
2. Add/change artifacts only inside that EVOL’s skeleton (`01-architecture`, `02-specs`, `03-interfaces`, …).
3. Use SemVer and update **STATE** as your document advances (DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → FROZEN).
4. Record context in `08-change-management/` so history remains auditable.

---

## Example: active seed evolution

* **EVOLUTION 00 – The Beginning**
  Includes early geometry/material baselines and first SPECs such as the **Wormhole Docking Tunnel** (ID `DECK000-0001`). Use it as a pattern for structure, naming, and evidence packaging.

---

## Governance & decisions

The **EVOL Board** arbitrates cross-cutting decisions and freezes. Day-to-day ownership and reviewer responsibilities are defined in `AGENTS.md`. If in doubt about scope, naming, or gate content—ask the Owner listed in the document front-matter before you branch.

---

## Related foundations

For system-wide engineering flow (from concept through operations), see **7.5.1 Engineering Process (Coarse → Fine)**; it aligns with the gates and artifacts referenced here and explains how requirements map to verification and operational evidence.

---

**License & IP** – See the root project notices for rights, usage, and compliance requirements. All contributions to 7.6 must remain auditable and traceable to requirements and reviews.

---

*You’re in the right place to build flight-worthy things. Keep it small, reviewable, and evidence-backed.*

## AGENTS.md — Roles, Responsibilities & EVOL Working Rules

> Applies to all engineering/product docs under `7.6-engineering/...`. **EVOL** is the primary organizing principle; every activity ensures **one SSOT per topic and EVOL**.&

### A) Agents & Short Aliases (with DISC scope)

| Role / Name                  | Alias          | Primary Discipline(s) (DISC) | Systems/Scope (SYS — examples) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Engineer **SGI Lina**        | `@sgi-lina`    | ARCH, STR                    | CORE, HULL, DECKS              |
| Engineer **Leo**             | `@eng-leo`     | OPS, TST                     | DOCK, LIFT                     |
| Engineer **Kai Nova**        | `@eng-kai`     | PROP, STR                    | PROP, CORE                     |
| Engineer **Mara Flux**       | `@eng-mara`    | PWR, THM                     | PDN, RAD                       |
| Engineer **Elias Core**      | `@eng-elias`   | SAF, REACTOR (↔ PWR)         | REACTOR, CORE                  |
| Economist **Alethea Voss**   | `@eco-alethea` | Markets / Impact             | —                              |
| Economist **Orion Hale**     | `@eco-orion`   | Investment / Impact          | —                              |
| **CFO Terra Chen**           | `@cfo-terra`   | Finance                      | —                              |
| Trade Analyst **Nova Reyes** | `@trade-nova`  | Transport / Materials        | DOCK, COMMS                    |
| **CEO Aris Vega**            | `@ceo-aris`    | Policy Gate                  | —                              |
| **COO Liora Stern**          | `@ops-lio`     | OPS                          | OPS                            |
| **CTO Jona Frame**           | `@cto-jona`    | ARCH, SW                     | CORE, COMMS                    |
| **CSO Mira Terra**           | `@cso-mira`    | SAF, ECLS                    | LHS, SAF                       |

**Codes:** DISC/SYS values follow 7.6.1.1 (ARCH, STR, THM, PWR, ECLS, SAF, GNC, PROP, OPS, ELEC, SW · CORE, HULL, DECKS, REACTOR, RAD, PDN, LHS, DOCK, LIFT, AIR, WAT, WASTE, COMMS).&

### B) Ownership Model (Owner & Reviewers)

Each document lists **Owner (DRI)** and **Reviewers** in **YAML front-matter**. Values must match the filename schema (EVOL, DISC, SYS/SYSID, LANG, STATE). **Exactly one SSOT per topic and EVOL** (state: APPROVED). &

**Owner duties**

* Technical correctness; maintain RFC/ADR/CR links; keep `supersedes/superseded_by` current.
* Keep naming, SemVer, and **STATE** consistent in filename & front-matter.
* Ensure traceability (Requirements → Interfaces → Verification).&

**Reviewer duties**

* Discipline review (DISC) + architecture/interface coherence; address risk/safety.
* Gatekeeper for **EVOL compliance** (no silent overwrites; changes via RFC/CR).&

**Minimum reviews by doc type**

* **SPEC/SRS/ICD/SAF/HAZ:** ≥ **2** — 1× discipline, 1× Arch/Safety (`@eng-elias` or `@cso-mira` or `@cto-jona`).
* **ADR:** ≥ **1** architecture review (`@cto-jona` or `@sgi-lina`).
* **RFC:** ≥ **2** (discipline + Arch/Safety) — decision recorded.
* **TST:** ≥ **1** discipline + **1** OPS (`@ops-lio`).
  These thresholds support states **DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → OBSOLETE** and the SSOT rule.&

### C) EVOL Duties & Visibility

* **Badge the generation everywhere:** filenames, paths, binaries, UI “About”, dashboards, API headers, contracts, and public comms carry **EVOL-XX**.
* **One EVOL, one SSOT per topic.**
* **`current-evolution.md`** points to the active EVOL README; on freeze, archive under `7.6.3-history/EVOL-XX/...`.
* **Compare Pages** (EVOL-(N-1) ↔ EVOL-N) and **Now/Next/Later** roadmaps are auto-built.  &

### D) Workflow (Issue → Freeze)

1. **Issue/Ticket:** Problem, objective, mapping to `DOC/DISC/SYS/SYSID/DECK`.
2. **RFC** if architecture/interfaces are impacted (motivation, impact, migration, decision path).
3. **Document change** under `7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX/...` with correct **filename schema** and **front-matter**.
4. **Open PR** (template below) — commit/PR titles include prefixes and **EVOL-XX**.
5. **Reviews & CI:** Lint (schema/front-matter), links, numbered tables/figures, SI units.
6. **Approval & Merge:** Set state to **APPROVED**, mark SSOT (`source_of_truth: true`).
7. **Release & Freeze:** Tag `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM`, release notes & migration guide; freeze and archive. &

### E) Commit / PR Conventions

**Commit/PR prefix:**
`[<DOC>][<DISC>][<SYS>][<SYSID>][EVOL-XX] short summary`

**PR template**

```markdown
#### Why
(Link to Issue/RFC; motivation)

#### What
(Key changes; affected files)

#### Impact
(Compatibility, risks, migration)

#### Verification
(Tests/sims/inspections; TST IDs)

#### Links
RFC/ADR/CR/Issues

#### Checklist
- [ ] Naming & front-matter consistent (EVOL/DISC/SYS/SYSID/LANG/STATE)
- [ ] Tables/figures numbered & referenced; SI units
- [ ] RFC/ADR/TST linked
- [ ] Minimum reviews requested (see Section B)
```

Aligned with 7.6.1.1 §§8–10 and CI rules.&

### F) Quality Gates (CI/Lint) & Merge Blockers

* **Hard lint checks:**

  * EVOL in path == EVOL in filename; regex schema satisfied.
  * Front-matter ↔ filename consistency (`id`, `evolution`, `discipline`, `system`, `system_id`, `seq`, `lang`, `state`).
  * SemVer valid; `STATE` consistent in name & front-matter.
* **Blockers:** missing reviews, broken RFC/ADR/CR links, wrong SemVer, stale `supersedes/superseded_by`.&

### G) Governance & Decisions (EVOL Board)

* **Open a new EVOL** only for **system-wide architectural breaks** / unshimmable interface breaks / changed ops doctrine.
* Submit request via **RFC** with impact analysis, migration, and customer narrative; board review (Architecture, Safety, Ops, Finance, Programs).
* **Freeze & fork forward:** freeze EVOL-N (read-only/patch-only), continue development in EVOL-(N+1).&

**Escalation**

* Cross-discipline conflict: moderation by `@cto-jona` (Architecture) + `@cso-mira` (Safety/Sustainability).
* Time-critical/Safety-critical: ad-hoc board (`@cto-jona`, `@eng-elias`, `@cso-mira`, Owner).&

### H) Role-Specific Responsibilities (excerpt)

* **@cto-jona (Architecture Gate):** architecture compliance, ADR index, EVOL-change gatekeeper.&
* **@cso-mira / @eng-elias (Safety Gate):** SAF/HAZ dossiers, ops doctrine, EVOL support windows.&
* **@ops-lio (Ops Gate):** SOPs, operations/maintenance chapters, VVP/V\&V coverage.&
* **@sgi-lina (Systems/STR):** structure/ICD coherence, Req↔Verification traceability.&
* **@eng-mara (PWR/THM):** energy/thermal flows, EVOL compare pages for PWR/THM ICDs.&
* **@eng-kai (PROP):** propulsion interfaces, migration paths for thrust/power changes.&
* **@eng-leo (OPS/TST):** test plans/reports, conformance (TST) ↔ SPEC/ICD.&
* **@cfo-terra / @eco-orion / @eco-alethea / @trade-nova (Economics/Transport):** release/freeze gates, support policy, migration cost awareness.&

### I) Quick Cheat Sheet

* **New SPEC?** → Filename per schema, fill YAML, link RFC, collect **2 reviews**, set state.&
* **Small fix?** → **PATCH** bump; semantic changes = **MINOR/MAJOR** (within the EVOL).&
* **Architectural break?** → RFC → Board → maybe **new EVOL**; freeze the old EVOL.&
* **Release?** → Tag `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM`, release notes + migration guide, verify `current-evolution.md`, publish compare pages. &

### Appendix 1: Filename Schema & Front-Matter (Quick Ref)

**Filename**
`<DOC>-<EVOL>-<DISC>-<SYS>-<SYSID>-<SEQ>-<TITLE>-<LANG>-v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>[<PRERELEASE>][+<BUILD>][-<STATE>].md`
Allowed fields/states/regex see 7.6.1.1 §§4–6 & §13. &

**Front-matter (required)**
`id, title, version, state, evolution, discipline, system, system_id, seq, owner, reviewers, source_of_truth, supersedes, superseded_by, rfc_links, adr_links, cr_links, date, lang` — values must match the filename.&

### Appendix 2: Example PR Title

```
[SPEC][STR][DECKS][DECK000][EVOL-01] hatch tolerances v1.1.0
```

Conforms to 7.6.1.1 §8 examples.&

### Validity & Maintenance

This document is the **SSOT** for roles/workflows in EVOL contexts. Changes via **RFC** only; approval by Architecture/Safety/Ops gates. Show the active EVOL badge in the header and maintain the EVOL README.&

# 7.6.1 Global Standards

Welcome! This folder defines the **project-wide rules** for how we name, version, structure, review, and ship every document in the Sphere Space Station *Earth ONE & Beyond* Single Source of Truth (SSOT). If you’re writing a spec, an interface control document, an ADR, an RFC, a test report, or a calculation note, **start here**.

---

## What lives here

* **Scope & Core Principles** — Why these standards exist and where they apply.
* **Folder Structure (top-down)** — How the SSOT is organized so content is discoverable and auditable.
* **Evolution Lifecycle** — From idea → draft → review → *freeze*; how documents mature alongside engineering work.
* **File-Naming Scheme** — A strict, machine-checkable pattern so docs are traceable and linkable.
* **Versioning & Document States** — SemVer + explicit states (e.g., `DRAFT`, `…`, `FROZEN`) to signal readiness.
* **Required YAML Front Matter** — The minimal metadata every file must declare.
* **Change Management** — How updates are proposed, reviewed, and recorded.
* **Commit Messages & PR Titles** — Conventions that feed automation and release notes.
* **CODE Tables** — Controlled vocabularies (document types, disciplines, systems, decks, states).
* **Templates** — Short, ready-to-use markdown stubs (SPEC, ICD, ADR, RFC, TST, CALC).
* **Quality Rules & CI/Lint** — Automated checks (regex, cross-refs, state transitions) that gate merges.

> The outline above corresponds to the “7.6.1 — Global Standards” section in the master documentation.

---

## Quick start

1. **Pick the right template** (SPEC / ICD / ADR / RFC / TST / CALC) from this folder’s `templates`. Each template maps to a **DOC** code in the CODE tables.
2. **Name your file** using the standard pattern below.
3. **Add required YAML front matter** (see sample + Appendix 14.3 for the full field list).
4. **Open a PR** with a compliant title; CI will lint filenames, front-matter, and cross-links.
5. Drive it through the **Evolution Lifecycle** until the document reaches the intended **state**.

---

## One last thing

When in doubt: **prefer traceability over brevity**. If your change affects safety, mission, budgets, or interfaces, make the intent obvious—in the filename, in the front-matter, and in the PR. The standards here exist so that every critical decision is **auditable, reproducible, and evolvable**.


\newpage

## 7.6.1.1 Guideline Document: Evolution‑Engineering-Naming-Folder Convention

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-08-10
**Status:** REVIEW

> Goal: Traceable, machine-sortable, version-safe documentation for a large-scale, multi-generation system. This makes **Evolution (EVOL) a first-class organizing principle** and aligns naming, foldering, and governance with product-generation thinking.

---

### 1) Scope & Core Principles

**Scope:** all engineering files under `7.6-engineering/`, including active evolutions and frozen history.

**Principles:**

* **Evolution-first:** Each product generation (EVOL-XX) is a self-contained, auditable capsule (architecture, specs, tests, ops). Breaking architectural changes open a **new EVOL**.
* **SSOT:** Single Source of Truth – exactly one **APPROVED** reference document per topic per EVOL.
* **Traceability:** Requirements → Interfaces → Verification. Every change references RFC/CR/ADR.
* **Readability & Sortability:** Short codes, fixed order, leading zeros, ISO date, SemVer, kebab-case titles.
* **Stability:** Discipline/System codes and folder schema are controlled; changes only via RFC.
* **Auditability:** History is frozen, signed/tagged, and never rewritten.

---

### 2) Folder Structure (Top‑Down)

```

**README per folder**: purpose, index, mandatory links (relevant ADR/RFC/TST) and ownership.

**Evolution Charter (`EVOL-XX/README.md`)** must include: scope & goals, compatibility promises, key risks, ADR index, exit criteria for freeze.

---

### 3) Evolution Lifecycle

1. **Initiate EVOL-XX** (charter, owners, scope).
2. **Work** (docs evolve under `7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX`).
3. **Release** (tag `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM`, set document states; symlink `current` may advance).
4. **Freeze & Archive** (move EVOL-XX to `7.6.3-history/`; read-only; security/Legal notes only).

---

### 4) File‑Naming Scheme (per document)

```text
<DOC>-<EVOL>-<DISC>-<SYS>-<SYSID>-<SEQ>-<TITLE>-<LANG>-v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>[<PRERELEASE>][+<BUILD>][-<STATE>].md
```

**Field definitions:**

* `DOC` (document type): **SPEC**, **SRS**, **ICD**, **ADR**, **RFC**, **CR**, **TST**, **CALC**, **DRAW**, **BOM**, **SOP**, **SAF**, **HAZ**, **VVP**.
* `EVOL` (evolution line): **00**, **01**, **02** … (product generation). Must match the parent `EVOL-XX` directory.
* `DISC` (discipline): **ARCH**, **STR**, **THM**, **PWR**, **ECLS**, **SAF**, **GNC**, **PROP**, **OPS**, **ELEC**, **SW**.
* `SYS` (system/subsystem examples): **CORE**, **HULL**, **DECKS**, **REACTOR**, **RAD**, **PDN**, **LHS**, **DOCK**, **LIFT**, **AIR**, **WAT**, **WASTE**, **COMMS**.
* `SYSID` (system reference): **DOCK01** … **DOCK05**, or **DECK000** … **DECK015**, or **ALL**, or **[A SPECIFIC SYSTEM]**….
* `SEQ` (sequential number per combination, e.g. multiple documents per unit): **0001**, **0002** …
* `TITLE` (kebab-case, ≤ 8 words).
* `LANG`: **DE**, **EN**.
* `v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>`: **SemVer** (see §5).
* `<PRERELEASE>` (optional): `-alpha.1`, `-beta.2`, `-rc.1`.
* `+<BUILD>` (optional): e.g., `+20250810`, `+git.abcdef`.
* `STATE` (optional, workflow status): **DRAFT**, **REVIEW**, **APPROVED**, **OBSOLETE**.

**Examples:**

```text
SPEC-01-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001-wormhole-docking-tunnel-EN-v1.0.0-DRAFT.md
ICD-01-THM-RAD-ALL-0044-radiator-icd-ports-DE-v1.3.0-REVIEW.md
ADR-01-ARCH-CORE-ALL-0003-spin-rate-baseline-EN-v1.0.0.md
RFC-01-SAF-REACTOR-DECK015-0007-shielding-upgrade-EN-v0.3.0-alpha.2.md
```

**Lint rule:** directory `EVOL-XX` and filename `EVOL` **must match**; PRs failing this are rejected.

---

### 5) Versioning (SemVer) & Document States

**SemVer:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

* **EVOL vs. MAJOR:** Breaking **architectural** changes (cross-cutting, system-wide) create a **new EVOL**. Within a given EVOL, use **MAJOR** for incompatible changes that remain scoped to that EVOL (e.g., an ICD break that does not warrant a new generation).
* **MINOR:** backward-compatible additions (new sections/requirements, clarifications).
* **PATCH:** editorial fixes (typos, formatting, non-semantic wording).
* **Prerelease:** `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N` until release.
* **Build:** `+YYYYMMDD` or `+git.<shortsha>` optional.

**States:** `DRAFT` → `REVIEW` (≥ 2 reviewers) → `APPROVED` (SSOT) → `OBSOLETE` (replaced).
Transition to **APPROVED** requires a linked RFC/CR and a verification reference if applicable.

---

### 6) Required YAML Front Matter

Every file starts with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
id: SPEC-01-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001
title: Wormhole Docking Tunnel – Structural Specification
version: v1.0.0
state: DRAFT
evolution: "01"
discipline: STR
system: [DECK]
system_id: [DECK000]
seq: [1111]
owner: "@sgi-lina"
reviewers: ["@saf-core", "@ops-lio"]
source_of_truth: true
supersedes: null
superseded_by: null
rfc_links: ["RFC-2025-0007"]
adr_links: ["ADR-01-ARCH-CORE-ALL-0003"]
cr_links: []
date: 2025-08-10
lang: EN
---
```

---

### 7) Change Management

* **RFC ID:** `RFC-YYYY-####` (e.g., `RFC-2025-0007`). Content: change, motivation, impact, migration, participants, decision.
* **CR ID:** `CR-YYYY-####` for implementation packages.
* **Process:** Issue → RFC (review) → decision → implementation (CR/PR) → update docs → test/accept → state change.
* **Superseding:** Old doc sets `superseded_by`, new doc sets `supersedes`. On EVOL freeze, move whole `EVOL-XX` to `7.6.3-history/`.
* **Tags:** On release/freeze, tag repo `EVOL-01-YYYY.MM` and record checksum of key artifacts (ICDs, SPECs, models, TST reports).

---

### 8) Commit Messages & PR Titles

**Format:**

```
[<DOC>][<DISC>][<SYS>][<DECK>][EVOL-XX] short summary

Body:
- why: motivation/issue link
- what: key changes
- impact: backward compat / risks
- refs: RFC/ADR/CR IDs
```

**Example:**

```
[SPEC][STR][DECKS][DECK000][EVOL-01] define hatch tolerances v1.1.0

why: close gaps from TST-... results
what: ±0.2 mm tolerance band, update figs 2–4
impact: compatible; requires retest case 2

### 11) Quality Rules

* One topic per document; split and cross-link large topics.
* Number all tables/figures; reference them in text; SI units with proper prefixes.
* Every numeric claim has a derivation/source; plots have axis labels & units.
* No “silent overwrites”: every change via RFC/CR; states updated accordingly.
* EVOL encapsulation: avoid cross-EVOL dependencies; shared assets only when truly identical and versioned.

---

### 12) Automation & CI

* **Linting:** enforce filename schema ↔ front matter consistency (EVOL, DISC, SYS, DECK, LANG, STATE).
* **Tagging:** generate `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM` tags and a signed manifest of key artifacts.
* **Compare Pages:** auto-build "EVOL-00 ↔ EVOL-01" diffs for ICDs/SPECs; publish in docs.

#### CI/LINT: Filename Regex & Cross-Checks

**Filename Regex:**

```regex
^(SPEC|SRS|ICD|ADR|RFC|CR|TST|CALC|DRAW|BOM|SOP|SAF|HAZ|VVP)-\d{2}-[A-Z]{2,4}-[A-Z0-9]+-[A-Z0-9]+-\d{4}-[a-z0-9-]{1,80}-(DE|EN)-v\d+\.\d+\.\d+(?:-(alpha|beta|rc)\.\d+)?(?:\+\S+)?(?:-(DRAFT|REVIEW|APPROVED|OBSOLETE))?\.md$
```

**Linting Cross-Checks:**

- EVOL in the directory path **must match** EVOL in the filename.
- YAML front-matter fields (e.g., `id`, `evolution`, `discipline`, `system`, `system_id`, `seq`, `lang`, `state`) **must match** corresponding filename segments.
- `state` field and filename suffix (e.g., `-DRAFT`, `-REVIEW`) **must be consistent**.

## 7.6.1.2 Guideline Document: The Evolution Principle

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** DRAFT

> Purpose: Make **Evolution (EVOL)** the primary internal and external identifier, organizing principle, and strategic driver. Ensure every stakeholder—engineering, operations, finance, partners, and customers—can see, audit, and plan around product generations.

---

### 1) Scope & Intent

This principle applies to all systems, subsystems, artifacts, and communications across the Sphere project. It operationalizes **Evolution‑first**: product generations (**EVOL‑00, EVOL‑01, …**) are self‑contained, auditable capsules that structure work, govern change, and frame expectations.

**Outcomes sought:**

* **Visibility:** Evolution state is instantly discoverable in code, docs, UI, packaging, and public comms.
* **Order:** Generations partition architectural eras; within a generation, SemVer governs compatible change.
* **Drive:** Generational goals and exit criteria create focus, motivate delivery, and anchor roadmaps.

---

### 2) What “Evolution” Means

**EVOL‑XX = Product Generation.**

* **Boundary:** A generation encapsulates architecture, interfaces, verification, and operations for its era.
* **Break rule:** A **system‑wide architectural break** opens a **new EVOL**. Within an EVOL, incompatible but scoped changes may increment **MAJOR** (SemVer) without starting a new generation.
* **Artifacts per EVOL:** Charter, architecture/ADR index, specs & ICDs, tests/V\&V, ops & SOPs, change log, release notes, migration guides, marketing copy, and a signed manifest.

**SemVer inside an EVOL:**

* **MAJOR:** Incompatible change **scoped to the EVOL** (e.g., an ICD break that does not require a new architecture era).
* **MINOR:** Backward‑compatible additions.
* **PATCH:** Editorial/non‑semantic fixes.

---

### 3) Why Evolution‑first (Vision)

1. **Internal compass.** Generations focus teams on a clear goal line (“What ships in EVOL‑01?”), simplify trade‑offs, and enable parallel work on EVOL‑N and EVOL‑(N+1).

2. **External signal.** Generations are a **customer‑facing identity** (like automotive model generations) that set expectations about capability, compatibility, and support windows.

3. **Audit & trust.** Each EVOL is an auditable capsule—design, tests, operations—supporting certifications, safety reviews, and partner due diligence.

4. **Strategic cadence.** Generational milestones drive funding gates, supplier readiness, and ecosystem planning.

---

### 4) Core Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Badge the generation everywhere.** Use EVOL labels in filenames, repo paths, binaries, UI About screens, dashboards, API headers, contracts, and marketing.
2. **One EVOL, one SSOT per topic.** Each topic has exactly one APPROVED reference document per EVOL.
3. **New EVOL on architectural break.** If compatibility cannot be maintained across the system boundary (architecture, safety, ops doctrine), you must open **EVOL‑(N+1)**.
4. **Freeze, then fork forward.** Freeze EVOL‑N (read‑only, patch‑only) and develop EVOL‑(N+1) in a separate capsule. No silent backports across EVOLs.
5. **Traceability is mandatory.** Every artifact in an EVOL links to its RFC/ADR/CR and V\&V evidence.

---

### 5) Lifecycle & Visibility

**Lifecycle:** Initiate → Work → Release → Freeze & Archive.

* **Initiate:** Write the *EVOL Charter* (scope, goals, compatibility promises, risks, exit criteria). Appoint owners and reviewers.
* **Work:** Produce and evolve all artifacts under `…/7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX/` with CI linting and manifesting.
* **Release:** Tag `EVOL-XX-YYYY.MM`, publish release notes and migration guides, update customer‑facing materials.
* **Freeze & Archive:** Move to `…/7.6.3-history/` (read‑only). Security and legal notices may update; functionality does not.

**Visibility mechanisms (required):**

* **current‑evolution.md** pointer in the evolutions root.
* **EVOL banner** in user‑facing UIs and operational dashboards.
* **Compare pages**: automated diffs EVOL‑(N‑1) ↔ EVOL‑N for key specs and ICDs.
* **Roadmap strip**: Now (EVOL‑N), Next (EVOL‑N+1), Later (N+2) on the program home page.

---

### 6) External Identity (Customer‑Facing)

**Generation labeling:**

* Public names include the generation, e.g., *Sphere Earth ONE — EVOL‑01*.
* Marketing and documentation lead with the EVOL identity; model‑year‑style messaging communicates evolution (capabilities, safety level, performance).

**Promises per EVOL:**

* **Compatibility window:** the minimum duration interfaces will be supported.
* **Support policy:** LTS/maintenance timelines per EVOL.
* **Migration path:** customer‑ready guides and tooling from EVOL‑(N‑1) to EVOL‑N.

**Automotive analogy (informative):** Like BMW model generations, each EVOL is a visible chapter with distinct architecture and capabilities, while trims/options map to MINOR/PATCH evolution within the generation.

---

### 7) Governance & Decision Criteria

**When to open a new EVOL:**

* Cross‑cutting architectural changes (safety doctrine, structural grid, power topology, thermal envelope, life‑support primitives).
* Interface breaks that cannot be shimmied without unacceptable cost or risk.
* Operational model change (e.g., new docking paradigm) that invalidates prior procedures.

**Gatekeeping:**

* Changes proposing a new EVOL require an **RFC** with impact analysis, migration plan, and customer‑facing narrative. A cross‑discipline board reviews (Architecture, Safety, Ops, Finance, Programs).

**Within‑EVOL change:**

* Use SemVer and ADR/RFC discipline; default to compatibility, prefer additive designs, and provide deprecation schedules.

---

### 8) Artifacts & Templates (per EVOL)

**Required:**

* **EVOL Charter** (scope, goals, risks, exit criteria).
* **Architecture overview** + **ADR index**.
* **SPEC/ICD set** with traceability to requirements and tests.
* **V\&V plan & reports**; acceptance evidence.
* **Ops handbook & SOPs**; safety dossier.
* **Change log & release notes**; **migration guide**.
* **Signed manifest** of key artifacts with checksums; EVOL tag.

**Template snippets (short):**

**EVOL Charter (outline)**

1. Scope & goals (what this generation must deliver)
2. Compatibility promises (what remains stable; for how long)
3. Risks & mitigations (top 5)
4. Exit criteria for freeze (objective tests & evidence)
5. Timeline: milestones to Release & Freeze

**Migration Guide (outline)**

1. Audience & prerequisites
2. What changed and why
3. Compatibility matrix (old ↔ new)
4. Step‑by‑step migration
5. Validation checklist & rollback

---

### 9) Foldering, Naming & CI Hooks (Summary)

* **Foldering:** Each EVOL lives under `7.6.2-evolutions/EVOL-XX/…`; frozen generations move to `7.6.3-history/EVOL-XX/…`.
* **Naming:** File names carry `<DOC>-<EVOL>-…-v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>-<STATE>.md`. EVOL in path **must** match filename.
* **CI Hooks:** Lint filename ↔ front‑matter coherence; generate EVOL tags and manifests; auto‑publish compare pages and release notes; block merges on missing RFC/ADR links.

---

### 10) KPIs & Rituals

**KPIs:**

* Generation goal completion rate (per milestone).
* Interface stability index (breaks avoided vs proposed).
* Migration lead time for key partners.
* Documentation completeness (SSOT coverage) at Release.

**Rituals:**

* **EVOL Review** (bi‑weekly): status, risks, decision log.
* **Interface Council** (monthly): compatibility & deprecations.
* **Freeze Readiness Review** (gate): verify exit criteria, lock manifests.
* **Customer Briefing** (at Release): public notes, support window, migration aids.

---

### 11) Non‑Goals (to avoid confusion)

* EVOL is **not** a marketing‑only label; it reflects real architectural eras.
* EVOL does **not** replace SemVer; it **frames** SemVer within a generation.
* EVOL changes do **not** rewrite history; prior EVOLs remain frozen and auditable.

---

### 12) Appendix – Quick Reference

**Open new EVOL if:** architecture or ops doctrine changes system‑wide; interfaces cannot be compatibly bridged; safety basis or certification envelope resets.

**Stay within EVOL if:** change is additive or can be shimmed; risk and cost of migration exceed benefit; safety and ops doctrine remain stable.

**Always do:** badge the generation, keep one SSOT per topic per EVOL, trace every change, publish migration paths, and freeze the past before building the future.

## 7.6.1.3 Evolution Deliverables & Phase Gates

**Effective date:** 2025‑08‑12
**Applies to:** All Evolutions under `7.6 Engineering`
**Audience:** Engineers, Test, QA, Safety/Security, Ops, EVOL Board
**Purpose:** Define the complete, auditable deliverables required to pass the four phase gates of an Evolution—**Proposal → Work → Review → Freeze**—for both **documents** and **products** (RIG/SIM/SUBSYS/SYS/DECK/SPHERE).

---

### 1. Scope & Principles

* Evolutions are **controlled change waves**. Each wave produces a **complete, releasable set** of documents and (where applicable) product artifacts.
* Every artifact must be **versioned**, **stateful** (`DRAFT` → `REVIEW` → `FROZEN`), and **traceable** to requirements and evidence.
* Phase gates are **Go/No‑Go decision points** owned by the EVOL Board.

---

### 2. Roles (responsibility summary)

* **Evolution Owner**: accountable for scope, schedule, quality; maintains the Evolution index.
* **Technical Reviewers** (discipline leads): approve content and test adequacy.
* **QA/Compliance**: verify format, metadata, traceability, and standards mapping.
* **Safety/Security**: own hazard analyses, threat models, and waivers.
* **Ops**: own runbooks, training, and operational readiness inputs.
* **EVOL Board**: gate decisions and conflict resolution.

---

### 3. Lifecycle Overview

1. **Proposal** — frame the problem, options, and plan. Output: *PDR‑quality* bundle.
2. **Work** — build, integrate, and prove feasibility. Output: *working drafts + demo evidence*.
3. **Review** — formal acceptance review. Output: *rc‑labeled packages + V\&V evidence*.
4. **Freeze** — release, baseline, and archive. Output: *immutable v1.0.0 + manifest*.

---

### 4. Deliverables by Phase (Documents)

#### 4.1 Proposal → Gate: EVOL Board “Go”

**Required**

* **RFC.md** (problem, goals/non‑goals, scope, constraints, success criteria).
* **Options & Decision Drivers** (trade study / alternatives matrix).

---

### 6. Evidence & Traceability

* **V\&V Matrix** is mandatory: requirement → spec clause → test case → result → dataset/seed.
* **Definition of Evidence (DoE)**: evidence must be **reproducible** (configs + seeds), **attributed** (who/when/tool‑version), and **integrity‑checked** (hashes).
* **Parameter Baseline** holds numerical knobs; changes require SemVer bump + re‑test scope.
* **Interface Locks** pin all external contracts by version and checksum.
* **Asset Map** ties `ASN ↔ CFGHASH ↔ Release‑Tag ↔ Documents/Tests` in machine‑readable form.

---

### 7. Versioning & States

* **SemVer** for documents and products (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
  ‑ `MAJOR`: incompatible changes; ‑ `MINOR`: added functionality; ‑ `PATCH`: fixes/no interface change.
* **States**: `DRAFT` → `REVIEW` → `FROZEN`. Release candidates use `‑rc` suffix.
* **Freeze** sets immutability; hotfixes require new patch release + minimal re‑tests.

---

### 8. Configuration Management

* **Product identity**: `CLASS‑PRODID‑VAR‑REV` (human‑readable), **ASN** (serial), **CFGHASH** (config hash).
* **product.yaml** is the single source of truth for each physical/simulated asset.
* **Digital twin**: every physical ASN points to a SIM snapshot + Golden Runs.

**Example `product.yaml`**

```yaml
id: DECK-015-PWR-01
class: DECK
variant: "01"
revision: "B0"
asn: "0001"

```

---

### 9. CI & Quality Gates

* **Front‑matter lint** (required fields), **filename regex**, **cross‑link checks**, **schema validation** for `product.yaml`.
* **Build/test**: unit tests; model/sim reruns; Golden Run regression; doc link checker.
* **Security/Safety**: minimum checklists (threat model/FMEA present) before review.
* **Blocking rules**: merge blocked until all required checks pass and required reviewers sign.

---

### 10. Acceptance & Readiness Reviews

* **SAT** (Site Acceptance): performed in Freeze phase; installation/ops readiness confirmed.
* **ORR/FRR** (Operational/Flight Readiness Reviews): required for **SPHERE** releases.

---

### 11. Release & Archival

* Tag the release (e.g., `EVOL-07.FROZEN.2025-08-12`).
* Copy frozen set to `7.6.3 History/EVOL-XX/` with `manifest.sha256`.
* Apply repository read‑only protection to frozen artifacts.

---

### 12. Templates & References

* Short‑form templates exist for **SPEC, ICD, ADR, RFC, TST, CALC**; start from those.
* Use the **Evolution index** (README of the Evolution) to link all deliverables.

# 7.6.2 Evolutions

This folder contains the **active engineering “Evolution” packages** for the Sphere Space Station Earth ONE and Beyond project. Each Evolution groups the current set of specs, interfaces, calculations, models, tests, and ops procedures that together define the system **as it is being changed right now**. Older waves move to `7.6.3 History`.

---

## What’s in here

* **Current Evolution(s)** — the live development wave(s) with their documents and work-in-progress artifacts. For example, the book lists **EVOLUTION 00 — The Beginning** as the starting wave.
* **Specs under this Evolution** — e.g.,
  `SPEC-00-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001-wormhole-docking-tunnel-EN-v0.1.0-DRAFT` (structure, decks, DECK000, EN locale, SemVer + state).

Each Evolution typically mirrors the reference layout used in the history section (standards/templates, architecture, specs, interfaces, calculations, models/sim, tests, ops, change management). When an Evolution closes, its content is frozen and archived to `7.6.3 History` (e.g., `EVOL-00/00-standards-templates`, `01-architecture`, `02-specs`, …).

---

## How Evolutions work (fast primer)

* **Evolution principle & lifecycle**: Evolutions are small, visible, and governed. They move from proposal → work → review → freeze, following the rules and lifecycle defined in **7.6.1 Global Standards** and **Guideline Document: The Evolution Principle**.
* **Governance & roles**: See **AGENTS.md — Roles, Responsibilities & EVOL Working Rules** for owners, reviewers, EVOL board decisions, and merge blockers.

---

## File naming, versioning, and states

Follow the **7.6.1 Global Standards** rigorously:

* **File-Naming Scheme** (document type, evolution code, discipline, system/deck IDs, language, SemVer, state).
  Example: `SPEC-00-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001-…-EN-v0.1.0-DRAFT`.
* **Versioning**: **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Increase versions per the change impact; keep states in sync.
* **Document States**: e.g., `DRAFT` → `REVIEW` → `FROZEN` (see “States (STATE)” code table).
* **Required YAML front matter**: include required metadata (doc type, evolution, owners, reviewers, state, version, etc.). CI will check this.

---

## Templates you’ll need

Short-form templates are provided for **SPEC, ICD, ADR, RFC, TST, CALC**. Start from these when adding documents to this Evolution.

---

## CI, quality gates, and merge rules

* **Quality rules & CI/Lint**: Filename regex, front-matter fields, and cross-checks are enforced. Fix issues before requesting review.
* **Commits & PRs**: Use the prescribed **commit message and PR title conventions** so traceability stays intact. Merge is blocked until reviews and checks pass per **EVOL board** rules.

---

## Contributing to this Evolution (checklist)

1. **Create/extend docs** using the correct **template + filename + front matter**.
2. **Reference codes/tables** (DOC types, DISC, SYS, DECK IDs, STATE) from the standards appendix.
3. **Run CI locally** where possible; fix lint and metadata errors.
4. **Open a PR** with compliant title/description; request the listed **owners/reviewers** in `AGENTS.md`.
5. **Address reviews**; once approved and CI is green, the EVOL board (or delegate) merges. **Frozen artifacts** will later be copied to `7.6.3 History` as the next wave starts.

---

## Quick pointers

* **Global standards & lifecycle, versioning, states, front matter, CI/Lint** → `7.6.1-global-standards` and **Guideline: The Evolution Principle**.
* **Roles, ownership, workflows** → `7.6-engineering/AGENTS.md`.
* **History and prior waves** → `7.6.3 History` (e.g., `EVOL-00` structure for reference).
* **Example active spec** → wormhole docking tunnel spec listed under EVOLUTION 00.

---

## Scope reminder

This folder is the **single source of truth for the *current* change wave**. If it’s not here (or linked from here), it’s not part of the active Evolution. Archive only after freeze; until then, keep everything auditable, versioned, and governed.

## [EVOLUTION 00 - The Beginning](EVOL-00\readme.md)


\newpage

# EVOLUTION 00 — The Beginning

EVOL00 is our first visible chapter: a minimal, end-to-end **working baseline** that proves the architecture in the real world. It is small by design, complete by necessity, and **auditable by default**. EVOL00 establishes the language of the system—structural grid, core interfaces, safety assumptions, and the build-test-operate chain—and makes **Evolution** the primary beacon, clear to team, partners, and users.

Success here isn’t feature breadth; it’s **trust**: a reproducible capsule that can be built, tested, operated, and learned from. When EVOL00 closes, we freeze a clean, signed baseline and open EVOL01 with confidence and velocity.

**Focus:** Clarity over scope · Safety over speed · Evidence over claims · Visibility everywhere.

### SPEC-00-STR-DECKS-DECK000-0001-wormhole-docking-tunnel-EN-v0.1.0-DRAFT 

**The Engineering of DECK000 – The Wormhole**

**Document status:** Draft (Evolution 1 – Baseline)
**Date:** 2025‑08‑10
**Applies to:** Earth ONE class sphere station (Ø 127 m)

---

#### 1 Abstract

DECK000 (“The Wormhole”) is the axial, pressurized docking and transit tube that runs straight through the station from the North pole to the South pole. In Evolution 1, the assembly is a 127 m long tube with an outer diameter of 22 m and a clear inner diameter of 20 m. The primary barrel is a silicon‑carbide (SiC) composite reinforced with steel or Inconel for toughness. Starting 3.5 m from the north polar end and repeating every 20 m along the axis, 10 m‑long Inconel docking‑ring subassemblies are installed and numbered sequentially (00, 01, 02 …) from North to South. Between docking rings, “window tube” segments provide outward viewing; each segment integrates rectangular window units of 4 m (axial) × 3 m (tall), built to the program’s space‑grade multilayer window specification (ALON/sapphire + fused silica + polycarbonate + borosilicate/cerium‑doped glass). The result is a micro‑g corridor (near the spin axis) enabling safe berthing, people/cargo transfer, observation, and emergency egress.

---

#### 2 Description (Evolution 1 – Baseline Geometry & Materials)

##### A. System Overview

* **Function:** Central polar docking, transit, and observation corridor in micro‑g; houses guidance, lighting, utilities, and emergency isolation points.
* **Overall length:** 127 m (North pole interior face to South pole interior face).
* **Primary diameters:** OD 22 m; ID 20 m (clear).
* **Primary structure:** SiC composite barrel; local reinforcement with steel/Inconel where penetrations, hatches, or docking hardware concentrate loads.
* **Environment:** Pressurized to station nominal (TBC; baseline 1 atm); micro‑g zone due to proximity to rotation axis.

##### B. Docking‑Ring Architecture

* **Ring modules:** 10 m axial length; OD 22 m (flush with main barrel OD); ID 10 m (constricted throat for docking hardware and hatchway integration).
* **Material:** Inconel (high‑temperature and corrosion resistance; excellent toughness).
* **Placement & numbering:** Starting **3.5 m** from the North pole interior face and repeating at a **20 m pitch**; numbered **00** (northmost) through **05** (southmost) in Evolution 1.

> **Note:** Evolution 1 uses six docking rings (00–05), preserving 3.5 m service clearances at both ends. Later evolutions may revise counts, spacing, or diameters based on interface selections and docking traffic models.

##### C. Window Segments & Glazing Units

* **Window units per segment:** Rectangular apertures integrated into the 10 m “window tube” spans; count and circumferential distribution TBD by human‑factors and structural analyses.
* **Nominal window aperture:** 4.0 m (axial) × 3.0 m (tall / meridional).
* **Glazing stack (per program spec):**

  * Outer strike face: **ALON** (or sapphire) \~50 mm for micrometeoroid & UV protection.
  * Middle layers: **Fused silica** (\~100 mm) + **polycarbonate** (\~50 mm) for thermal stability and impact energy absorption.
  * Inner layer: **Borosilicate** (or cerium‑doped glass) \~30 mm for radiation attenuation and optical quality.
  * **Total thickness:** \~200–300 mm; **areal mass:** \~530–550 kg/m².
* **Shutters & shields:** Each aperture integrates internal blast shutters and external micrometeoroid/thermal shades; automatic closure on pressure loss or debris alerts.

##### D. Structural Concept

* **Primary barrel wall:** Thickness TBD from combined loads (pressure, docking loads, thermal gradients). Preliminary design envelope to meet FoS ≥ 2.0 against yield under 1 atm differential plus ring‑induced stress concentrations.
* **Ring‑to‑barrel joints:** Circumferential flanges with shear keys; dual redundant, high‑temperature elastomer seals (silicone‑based) with metallic C‑seals for vacuum‑rated redundancy.
* **Local reinforcements:** Around windows (doubler frames), utility penetrations, and docking hardware. Use SiC/steel hybrid frames to spread aperture loads into the barrel laminate.
* **Thermal control:** Embedded liquid heat loops (glycol‑water or silicone oil), MLI blankets on the outside of the barrel segments not occupied by windows, and conductive paths to station radiators.

##### E. Interfaces & Services

* **Mechanical:** Hard‑points in each docking ring for adapter hardware, hatches, grapples, and temporary airlocks.
* **Avionics & comms:** Redundant comm rails, guidance beacons, and visual docking aids integrated at each ring; cableways routed in protected trunking.
* **Life support:** Distributed air distribution manifolds, CO$_2$ scrubber returns, water/condensate drains, and emergency O$_2$ drop lines.
* **Power:** Dual independent DC buses along the tube with local UPS for shutters, lighting, and hatch actuators.
* **Safety:** Pressure‑isolation bulkheads at ring boundaries (ring can be sealed as a compartment), blast doors for window segments, fire detection & inert‑gas suppression.

##### F. Operations & Human Factors

* **Micro‑g ergonomics:** Handrails, foot restraints, and guided translation lines throughout; lighting graded for approach/egress; color‑coded wayfinding matching station standards.
* **Traffic separation:** North pole dedicated to arrivals, South pole to departures (baseline); center‑tube signage and beacons enforce counter‑flow.
* **Emergency egress:** Clearly marked safe‑hold nodes at each ring with comms, masks, and emergency supplies; shutters auto‑close upon hazard detection.

##### G. Manufacturing & Assembly

* **Moduleization:** 10 m modules (alternating ring modules and window‑tube modules) pre‑fitted with internal systems; on‑orbit assembly via circumferential bolted/bonded joints.

### 8.4.1 Appendix A: Abstract – Sphere Space Station Earth ONE and Beyond  
*Date: 2025-08-08*

The *Sphere Space Station Earth ONE & Beyond* project presents a comprehensive vision for a sustainable, modular, and expandable orbital habitat designed to serve as a cornerstone for humanity’s long-term presence in space.  
At its core, the Earth ONE station is a 127-meter-diameter rotating sphere with sixteen coaxial cylindrical decks, each offering distinct artificial gravity levels, and a total capacity of approximately 700 inhabitants. The design integrates advanced closed-loop life support systems, high-efficiency nuclear and solar hybrid energy supply, robust thermal and radiation shielding, and modular docking infrastructure for spacecraft and robotic vehicles.

The documentation outlines technical specifications, material selection (including high-performance SiC-based composites), operational infrastructure, governance structures, economic feasibility, environmental sustainability goals, and phased expansion strategies toward lunar, asteroid belt, and deep-space stations.  
A dedicated consortium model, public engagement strategy, and alignment with international space governance frameworks ensure transparency, cooperation, and equitable access to technology and benefits.

Beyond Earth ONE, the *Beyond* program foresees the deployment of autonomous stations, interplanetary cyclers, exploration crafts, and unmanned freight transporters to establish a connected network throughout the Solar System. This initiative aims not only to advance space science and industry but also to serve as a scalable blueprint for future off-world habitats and to inspire sustainable innovation on Earth.

### 8.4.2 Overview of Documentation Contents

The Sphere Space Station Earth ONE and Beyond project is supported by comprehensive documentation covering all relevant thematic areas. The existing ten main documents address the station’s technical specifications, infrastructure and personnel, energy supply and thermal management, governance structures, public engagement, economic feasibility analyses, environmental and sustainability concepts, plans for future expansion of the station network, global space governance, and self-sustainability models. Thus, the core “subject areas”—from technical through organizational and financial to sustainability and public participation—are fundamentally addressed. Below, the completeness, depth, and maturity of these areas as well as their mutual alignment are assessed. A summary table (Table 1) provides an overview of each area’s maturity level and interoperability.

---

#### 8.4.2.1 Maturity Level and Interoperability of Subject Areas

The documentation is extremely comprehensive in most areas. Table 1 summarizes the assessment of each field with regard to **Content Maturity** (completeness/depth) and **Interoperability** (consistency/linkage to other areas).

#### 8.4.2.2 Particularly Mature Areas

The station’s technical design (structure, systems, safety) is exceptionally thorough. Document 1 describes every central system—from rotational gravity to energy supply and emergency systems—with detailed specifications. The energy and thermal management plan combines two 60 MW small modular reactors (or alternatively 20 micro-reactors) with large solar arrays for redundancy, and outlines energy storage (liquid heat storage), deployable radiators, and insulation strategies. The economic planning is similarly advanced: a sophisticated business plan details development costs (~~€1 bn), transport (~~€8.5 bn), annual operating expenses (\~€25 M/yr), revenue streams (rental of living quarters, laboratories, tourism), pricing, and forecasts a 12–15-year return on investment. These analyses provide a solid economic foundation. The environmental and sustainability concept (Document 7) sets clear principles—resource efficiency, closed-loop life support, recycling—and concrete measures such as CO$_2$ reclamation, water recycling, waste composting for hydroponics, and strict hazardous materials protocols. This demonstrates high technical maturity in self-sufficiency planning and minimizing external resupply needs.

Likewise, the infrastructure, staffing, and living-space planning is very detailed. Staffing categories (operational crew, scientists, support personnel) and comprehensive habitat designs (emergency surgery, quarantine labs, fitness center, library, simulated “outdoor” spaces, schools, university-level labs, living quarters for crew and visitors) for approximately 700 occupants are fully defined, showing that daily life and work needs have been thoroughly addressed.

---

#### 8.4.2.3 Moderately Developed Areas

The organizational and governance documentation is solid but more conceptual than the technical sections. Document 4’s consortium model outlines involvement of space agencies, companies, research institutions, investors, and governance bodies (consortium council, executive board, expert panels), addressing decision-making, conflict resolution, and funding phases. While well-designed for transparent international collaboration, concrete partners and legal structures remain to be specified. Public engagement (Document 5) proposes transparency campaigns, educational curricula, live broadcasts, citizen-science initiatives, and decentralized “Sphere” clubs for global participation. These measures are ambitious but still generic; resource allocation and structural alignment (e.g., between a PR department and local clubs) require further elaboration.

Two elements are more visionary than concrete: the Solar Alliance governance concept (Document 9) and the self-sufficiency models (Document 10). The Solar Alliance sketches a democratically legitimized coalition of all spacefaring nations to regulate activities across the solar system, aiming to prevent resource conflicts, harmonize safety standards, and ensure fair participation. Though aligned with the project’s sustainable and international values, it remains detached from Earth ONE’s immediate implementation. The self-sufficiency models classify autonomy levels—from full autarky for distant missions (e.g., Kuiper Belt) to basic support near Earth—but serve as theoretical frameworks rather than Earth ONE–specific development plans, since circular economy and backup systems are already covered elsewhere.

---

#### 8.4.2.4 Consistency, Interoperability, and Harmonization

Overall consistency between areas is high. Documents reference shared parameters and complement each other. For example, Earth ONE is consistently described as a 127 m spherical habitat for \~700 people; this assumption underpins the technical concept (Doc. 1), operational planning (Doc. 2), and financial models. The energy and sustainability documents (Docs. 3 and 7) both specify a mix of solar arrays and two primary reactors plus reserves. Technical details (60 MW SMRs) appear nearly verbatim across Docs. 1 and 3. Closed-loop life-support systems (air, water, waste) mentioned in Doc. 1 are elaborated in Doc. 7 (CO$_2$ scrubbers, water purification, composting). Deck layouts—general in Doc. 1 (living/work areas mid-decks, industry/storage outer decks)—are refined in Doc. 8 with specific functions per deck (decks 6–10 residential, deck 15 reactors, decks 2–3 life support).

Interdependencies are clearly signposted: the sustainability document’s lunar resource utilization appears in Doc. 8 via the “Lunar ONE” outpost and moon-mining incentives; Doc. 4’s governance structure provides a PR/outreach division to implement Doc. 5’s engagement activities; Doc. 6’s financial model incorporates Doc. 2’s leasing revenue assumptions; and Doc. 8’s expansion vision integrates market analyses (e.g., space tourism). Minor variances—such as a 12–15-year vs. 15–20-year break-even estimate—are negligible and stem from cautious projections. A gap remains in embedding the Solar Alliance in core documents, but this reflects its long-term visionary status rather than an oversight for Earth ONE itself.

---

#### 8.4.2.5 Potentials, Risks, Objectives, and Feasibility (Overall Assessment)

The documentation conveys a visionary yet well-considered project. Objectives are clear: Earth ONE as a sustainable, permanent LEO outpost fostering science, commerce, and international exchange—evident from the mission statement in Doc. 1 to public engagement in Doc. 5. Long-term expansion to the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc., is firmly anchored. The project could enable scientific breakthroughs (microgravity labs, space-based astronomy), spur new industries (materials research, pharmaceuticals, space mining), and invigorate space tourism. Economically, early positioning in an orbital market—accommodation, research services, satellite servicing, media offerings—promises significant returns. Socially, the station offers STEM inspiration and international cooperation. The closed-habitat ecology could model efficient terrestrial resource use, and Earth ONE may serve as a springboard for multi-planetary expansion.

However, substantial risks exist. Technically, a 127 m rotating habitat for hundreds demands advanced, sometimes unproven technologies (modular large-scale components, long-lived space reactors, life-support for 700, radiation shielding). In-orbit assembly of over 1 million tons (5,000 launches) is unprecedented, with no detailed logistical plan. Financially, \~€9–10 bn investment and unprecedented funding collaboration are required; if anticipated revenue streams (tourism, commercial labs) underperform, ROI may be delayed or profitability endangered. Business assumptions (pricing, occupancy, maintenance) carry high sensitivity, though Doc. 6 outlines risk factors and countermeasures. Regulatory and public acceptance—particularly of nuclear reactors in orbit—pose further challenges (space debris, radiation, military implications). The documentation addresses these via the Solar Alliance concept and stringent safety standards (multi-layer shielding, micrometeoroid protection, evacuation capsules), but geopolitical unpredictability remains.

Despite these challenges, the documentation outlines realization paths: Earth ONE as a demonstrator to build know-how (recycling, long-term habitability) for “Beyond” projects. No conceptual contradictions render the project impossible—every major issue has a proposed solution. The transition from paper to practice requires feasibility studies, prototypes, and political alliances. Actual feasibility must be proven through an intensive development and validation process.

---

#### 8.4.2.6 Recommendations and Next Steps

Below are the most sensible next steps from both a technical/content perspective (“logical next step”) and a strategic/project perspective (“smartest next step”). Both aim to advance the documented concepts toward implementation and close remaining gaps.

##### 8.4.2.6.1 Next Logical Development Step (Technical/Content)

**Recommendation:** Develop an integrated development and implementation roadmap to link all concepts. This master plan should define phases, milestones, and responsibilities—from R\&D through prototype construction to station assembly—and concretely align technical, organizational, and financial subplans. Key stages should include:

* **Technology Demonstrations:** Earth-based or small-scale orbital prototypes (rotating gravity, closed-loop life support) to validate key systems under real conditions.
* **Pilot Projects:** Integration tests for critical areas (CO$_2$ recycling, water purification, hydroponics; small-scale space reactor or advanced radiator demos) to mitigate risks early.
* **Orbital Assembly Trials:** Robotics or automated systems development using platforms such as the ISS to test on-orbit construction techniques.
* **High-Level Timeline:** Schematic of module production, \~5,000 launches, and in-orbit assembly sequence, accounting for dependencies (e.g., life support readiness before crew arrival).

This roadmap will unite parallel concept documents, reveal bottlenecks (launch capacity, personnel training, regulatory approvals), and incorporate risk analyses and fallback strategies (alternative technologies, modular capacity adjustments). Translating building blocks into a detailed action plan will provide internal clarity and external credibility.

##### 8.4.2.6.2 Strategically Smartest Next Step (Project Strategy)

**Recommendation:** Forge a powerful real-world alliance/consortium and secure political backing, e.g., by launching an international flagship project under EU leadership. Early stakeholder engagement and binding commitments will generate momentum. Concrete measures include:

* **Champion Partners:** Engage ESA/EU leadership, NASA or other agencies for module support, and private companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin) for launch services; formalize via bilateral agreements or MoUs.
* **Coordination Conference:** Convene space agencies, industry, research, regulators to present Sphere Earth ONE and establish an international coordination body, building on Doc. 4’s consortium council.
* **Political Positioning:** Place the project at EU Council, UN COPUOS, etc., to secure support and regulatory waivers (e.g., orbital nuclear operations); embed Earth ONE in European space programs as a flagship initiative.
* **Financing Pipeline:** Pursue EU research frameworks and ESA calls for targeted technology funding (life support, recycling, radiation protection) while engaging major investors early to shape financing consortia.

This strategic step institutionalizes the visionary concept, addresses the biggest uncertainties—political and public acceptance—and prevents competing parallel initiatives by positioning Sphere Earth ONE as the central European-international space station project. Early successes (cooperation agreements, initial funding) will catalyze public interest and broader support, aligning with the public engagement strategy.

---

**Summary:** The project should advance on two fronts: internally via a consolidated implementation plan (“what” and “when”) and externally via a robust alliance (“who” and “how to fund”). The documentation has made the vision tangible—these next steps can transform a visionary foundation into a concrete, collaborative mega-project.

#### 8.4.5.3 AI-Assisted QA Pipeline

1. **Import**: New or changed documents are automatically loaded into the AI QA workflow.
2. **Pre-Check (Syntax & Structure)**: AI checks format, chapter numbering, and table integrity.
3. **Semantic Analysis**:

   * Cross-document check (e.g., material data in 2.2 vs. 7.2.1)
   * Alignment of numerical values and terminology
4. **Safety Simulation**: AI simulates scenarios (e.g., fire, radiation leak, pressure loss) based on Sec. 2.1.5 & 2.1.6, compares procedures with standards, and flags deviations.
5. **Issue Tagging**:

   * `CONTRADICTION` – conflicting information
   * `MISSING` – missing mandatory content
   * `PLACEHOLDER` – placeholder text without content
6. **QA Report**: Automatically generated table with:

   * Location (chapter, line)
   * QA category (see above)
   * AI recommendation for correction
7. **Review & Approval**: QA team reviews AI suggestions, confirms changes, and triggers versioning (Sec. 7.3).
