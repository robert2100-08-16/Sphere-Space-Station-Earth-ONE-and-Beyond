This folder stores VS Code configuration files for launching and working with the simulation.
The provided `launch.json` lets you run `run_simulation.py` directly from the editor.
It also includes configurations `Blender Deck Simulation` and `Blender Hull Simulation` which start Blender
via their respective `blender_starter.py` scripts (requires the environment variable `BLENDER_PATH`).
`settings.json` contains defaults for previewing generated results.
