This folder stores VS Code configuration files for launching and working with the simulation.
The provided `launch.json` lets you run `run_simulation.py` directly from the editor.
It also includes a configuration `Blender Deck Simulation` which starts Blender
via `blender_starter.py` (requires the environment variable `BLENDER_PATH`).
`settings.json` contains defaults for previewing generated results.
