abstract: >
  The Sphere Space Station Earth ONE and Beyond project provides a comprehensive and technically feasible
  vision for sustainable human habitats in space. It combines rotating artificial gravity architecture,
  advanced energy and recycling systems, modular construction, and decentralized governance models to
  enable long-term operations in Low Earth Orbit and beyond. The documentation addresses structural design,
  environmental systems, economic models, and future expansion into the inner and outer Solar System.
