# 1. AGENT Instructions

- Ensure each directory in this repository contains a brief `README.md` describing its purpose. Add one whenever a new folder is created.
- Maintain `project/sphere-space-station-earth-one/01-project-planning/02-engineering/02-concepts/construction-handbook.md` as the construction handbook for engineering updates. Document simulation-specific progress in `project/sphere-space-station-earth-one/01-project-planning/08-simulations/software-design-decisions.md` or `simulations/docs/architecture`.
