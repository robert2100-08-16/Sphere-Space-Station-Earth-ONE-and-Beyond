- Ensure each directory in this repository contains a brief `README.md` describing its purpose. Add one whenever a new folder is created.
- Maintain `documents/Konstruktionshandbuch.md` as the construction handbook. Update it with design decisions and release notes whenever the Blender simulation or related design files change.
