# Acceptance Report Sprint L3-4

Sprint 4 of the plan "STEP/glTF Integration & CAD Detailing" (10 Nov 2025 – 21 Nov 2025) aimed to integrate the new exporters, document the workflow and introduce continuous quality assurance. The repository's current state was evaluated against the sprint goals.

## Completed Points

| Topic | Implemented Status | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic CI pipeline | A GitHub Actions workflow runs linting and the unit test suite for Python code. | `.github/workflows/python-package.yml` |
| Legacy CSV cleanup | Geometry transport via CSV has been removed; remaining CSV files are limited to analytical reports. | `simulations/docs/architecture/readme.md` |

## Still Open / Deltas

| Planned Task | Current State | How it needs to be implemented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Integration tests** | No end-to-end test (`tests/test_integration.py`) exists. | Add a test that generates geometry, exports STEP/glTF and verifies Blender or a viewer can import the files. |
| **Documentation update** | Main README and architecture docs remain monolingual and lack migration notes. | Provide bilingual documentation with examples of new CLI options and the layer model. |
| **Refactoring & cleanup** | Historical references to `deck_3d_construction_data.csv` remain (e.g., in `simulations/deck_calculator/description.md`). | Remove outdated CSV mentions and ensure consistent naming/PEP8 across modules. |
| **Continuous Integration** | No dedicated workflow file (`ci.yml`) for STEP/glTF exports or Blender scripts. | Create a workflow that runs exporters, tests Blender imports and uploads STEP/glTF artifacts. |
| **Stakeholder review & backlog** | No `project/backlog.md` capturing feedback exists. | Create the backlog file summarizing stakeholder feedback and follow-up items. |

## Conclusion

From the product owner's perspective, Sprint 4 has not been completed. While a basic CI pipeline and the removal of CSV-based geometry transport are in place, key deliverables—integration tests, comprehensive documentation, a dedicated CI workflow and a stakeholder backlog—are still missing. These items should be addressed before Sprint L3 can be considered finished.
