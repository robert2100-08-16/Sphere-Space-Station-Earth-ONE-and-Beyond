**Evaluation of Sprint 3 (STEP/glTF Integration & CAD detailing)**

The sprint plan for sprint L3 (27 Oct – 07 Nov 2025) clearly defined several goals: expanding the deck/hull geometry with supports, corridors, window frames, emergency exits and docking ports, adding material and colour attributes, implementing detail animations, providing an example Blender scene and extending tests.  During a second review of the repository, the current implementation only partially addresses these requirements.

### What has been delivered

* **New parameters for supports and docking ports:** The simulation engine’s `SphereDeckCalculator` introduces parameters (`supports_per_deck`, `num_docking_ports`, `docking_port_diameter`) and computes locations for supports.  A `Material` data class exists and default materials (“Stahl” and “Glas”) are used.  These additions align with the sprint plan’s requirement to begin adding structural details and materials.
* **Material handling in exporters:** The glTF exporter creates GLTF materials with PBR properties depending on the `Material` name (e.g., metallic/roughness values for steel and glass).  The STEP exporter attaches material metadata to deck/hull/base ring/wormhole solids.
* **Basic rotation animation:** The glTF exporter still provides the simple rotation animation of the whole station noted in prior sprints.

### Deltas – what is still missing

1. **Geometry for corridors, window frames and emergency exits.**

   * The current data model has no classes or structures for corridors, frames or emergency exits.
   * The `SphereDeckCalculator` only computes support positions; there is no geometry for supports or docking ports, and nothing for corridors or emergency exits.
   * **To complete:** define DTOs (e.g., `Corridor`, `WindowFrame`, `EmergencyExit`, `Support`, `DockingPort`) in `data_model.py` with appropriate dimensions and materials; extend `SphereDeckCalculator` to calculate their geometry using CadQuery; integrate these objects into the station model (decks or hull) and attach them to the correct deck/hull positions.

2. **Exporting the new details.**

   * Neither the glTF exporter nor the STEP exporter references supports, docking ports, corridors, window frames or emergency exits.
   * **To complete:** update `_build_deck_mesh` and `_build_hull_mesh` in the glTF exporter to accept lists of additional solids and window frames, convert them to meshes and assign proper materials.  For the STEP exporter, create helper functions to build B‑Rep solids for each new component and add them to the assembly with the correct metadata.

3. **Material assignment & colours.**

   * Although a `Material` class exists, new components will need appropriate materials (e.g., distinct colours for emergency exits or docking ports) and default assignments.
   * **To complete:** define standard materials (e.g., steel, aluminium, glass, polymer) with RGBA colours; update the CLI and data model so users can specify materials for each component; ensure exporters call `_ensure_material` and include these materials in the GLTF output.

4. **Detail animations.**

   * The current glTF exporter only provides a rotation animation of the entire station; there are no door/hatch animations or moving docking ports.
   * **To complete:** design animations for dynamic parts (opening/closing emergency exits, extending docking ports).  Use glTF animation channels (samplers and channels) to animate translations/rotations of the corresponding nodes.  Provide an API in the data model to define animation sequences and durations.

5. **Blender example scene.**

   * The sprint plan calls for a Blender example of the detailed model with animations, but no `.blend` or instructions are provided.
   * **To complete:** create an example scene in Blender by importing the exported glTF, verify that geometry and animations render correctly, add cameras and lighting, and supply the `.blend` file in the repository.  Document the workflow in a README.

6. **Testing & CLI integration.**

   * There are currently no tests covering the new geometry or exports.  Existing tests focus on simple placeholder meshes.
   * **To complete:** write unit tests verifying that the new DTOs are created correctly, the `SphereDeckCalculator` generates the expected number and placement of supports, corridors and exits, and that glTF and STEP exporters include these elements with correct materials and animations.  Update CLI scripts to accept parameters for the number of supports/docking ports, corridor widths, etc., and add tests to ensure CLI options work.

7. **Documentation updates.**

   * The sprint plan required updating documentation to describe new features.  The repository’s README and module docstrings still reflect the earlier simplified model.
   * **To complete:** expand the README and module docs to describe the new data classes, CLI options, supported materials, and example usage.  Ensure the sprint‑plan file is updated when tasks are complete.

### Summary and guidance

The current implementation has made progress in adding material classes and starting support and docking port parameters.  However, most of the sprint‑L3 deliverables remain unfulfilled: there is no corridor, window frame or emergency exit geometry; exporters do not output supports or docking ports; materials are not assigned comprehensively; no detail animations or Blender scene exists; tests and documentation are missing.  To close sprint 3, the development team needs to implement the missing data models, compute and export the new geometry, assign materials, create animations, provide examples and tests, and update documentation as outlined above.
