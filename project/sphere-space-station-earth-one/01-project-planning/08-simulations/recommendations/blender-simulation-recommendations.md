# Blender Simulation Recommendations

This document summarizes an analysis of how Blender or similar 3D rendering engines can enhance simulations and visualizations for the Sphere Space Station Earth ONE and Beyond project.

## Analysis
- The repository currently includes a Python script (`simulations/deck_calculator/deck_calculations_script.py`) that generates deck geometry and simple animations with Matplotlib.
- The provided PDF "Bewertung der Dokumentation" advises creating an integrated roadmap and building strategic partnerships.
- No Blender files or advanced rendering assets are present in the repository.

## Recommendations
1. **Integrate Blender for High-Fidelity Visualization**
   - Export geometry data from existing scripts and import it into Blender via its Python API.
   - Use Blender to apply detailed materials, lighting, and advanced animations.

2. **Extend Simulation Capabilities**
   - Utilize Blender's physics and particle systems to model life-support flows, assembly sequences, and ergonomic studies.

3. **Leverage Blender for Stakeholder Communication**
   - High-quality renders and interactive scenes can support funding efforts and public outreach in line with PDF suggestions.

4. **Suggested Pipeline**
   - Generate geometry → export to GLTF/FBX → import into Blender → apply materials and animations.
   - Automate this pipeline so updated engineering data translates easily into new renders.

5. **Licensing Considerations**
   - Simulation scripts are MIT-licensed; maintain attribution when integrating with Blender.
   - Respect proprietary and CC BY-4.0 licenses for documentation and derivative works.
